BJP-AAP vote share gap is quite small. So, what swung the election decisively in BJP’s favour? Some short takes:

Saffron's long march

Taking the middle out



‘Fakes’ among freebies

Brand Kejriwal loses sheen



Modi hai toh…

NEW DELHI: The national capital on Saturday witnessed a saffron tsunami with the BJP securing a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.Aam Aadmi Party, however, maintained a stronghold in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated constituencies.What seemed to have worked in favour of the BJP was the, middle class andfactor (excise policy case), along with the ""sheeshmahal"" attack on AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal during the poll campaign.What seemed to not have worked in AAP's favour were issues like poor roads, traffic congestion, Yamuna pollution, and poor air quality.BJP’s campaign for Delhi started much before polls were announced. Every bad headline against AAP was followed by a sustained BJP campaign, hurting the incumbent. Closer to elections, ‘sheesh mahal’, as BJP cleverly named the generously refurbished CM residence, hurt AAP’s image even more.After initially criticising AAP’s freebie game, BJP, too, made populist promises with gusto. BJP also talked up the idea of a double-engine sarkar, even as perceptions of govt dysfunctionality took hold, in part thanks to the LG-AAP fight. By the time polls were held, many voters had bought BJP’s argumentVote-share stats make it clear AAP has lost little of its core low-income vote. BJP would have always strategised with that assumption — and therefore it targeted Delhi’s neo-middle class and middle class, who were more upset with the state of roads, traffic, Yamuna, and air pollution than they were impressed by free water, power and primary health care.To that, BJP added the announcement of the 8th Pay Commission — Delhi voters include many govt employees and their families — and the Budget’s income tax cuts.BJP campaigned hard against some elements of AAP’s welfare policy regime. ‘Fake medicines’ and ‘ghost patients’ in free mohalla clinics was one such campaign. AAP contested these claims hotly.But some of those charges stuck when coupled with demonstrable failures like Yamuna ﬂowing as dirty as ever and desperate AAP claims like Haryana’s BJP govt ‘poisoning’ Yamuna water.That AAP suffered big losses in seats along the Haryana border tells this story powerfully.Kejriwal started as a ‘humble man of the people’ who didn’t want to stay in govt bungalows. But he came into these polls as a very different leader. He and his colleagues didn’t recognise that aside from anti-incumbency against AAP, there was anti-incumbency against Kejriwal himself.When things turned against AAP, Modi’s appeal, dormant in the last two assembly polls, came to the fore. He was front and centre in BJP’s campaign and his sharp attacks and promises of smooth coordination between the Centre and Delhi made an appreciable difference","Bjp secured a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.

KejriWall to KejriFall: How a crusader lost his way & vision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kejriwall-to-kejrifall-how-a-crusader-lost-his-way-vision/articleshow/118080246.cms,"Once upon a time, there was an Arvind Kejriwal . A crusader against corruption, he brought back forgotten words, such as integrity and idealism, into the political discourse and created immense possibilities of an alternative model of clean governance. His first swearing-in ceremony at Ramlila Maidan in the winter of 2013 didn’t feel like a momentary celebration of people’s power.It was more like the beginning of a movement for positive change in the way politics was conducted in the country. Thousands of ageing men and women had turned up from every corner of India Ignored, from distant states like Telangana and Tamil Nadu. Even his off-key rendition of, “Insaan ka insaan se ho bhaichara ” (film: Paigham), was no dampener.For them, in short, Kejriwal was an icon of hope for a new, fearless India.In the weeks and months that followed, Kejriwal grew in reputation as an individual and politician. Often dressed in a bush shirt, carrying a cheap ballpoint pen in his shirt pocket and wearing ordinary chappals, he became the perfect picture of austerity. And he kept his electoral promise of free water and electricity, schemes that endeared him to the city’s teeming lower-income class.When AAP , formed in 2012, returned a second time to office in 2015 with a crushing majority to stop the ModiShah juggernaut, Kejriwal became a hero of everyone opposed to BJP. And, yes, despite the ever-present cough and the comforting muffler around his head, he slept on the streets of Delhi in the winter cold as a protesting chief minister. Those days the former-IRS-of ficer-turned-activist-turned-politician — also a recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay award — walked the talk.But over the years, slowly but surely, the hallowed persona of a CM with a frugal lifestyle wore off. And, on Saturday, the after-effect was seen in the outcome of the Delhi assembly polls. Two full terms and 49 days since it first assumed office in 2013, AAP suffered a shattering and humbling defeat. And Kejriwal, the party’s founder and beating heart, who had once bested then formidable CM Sheila Dixit by over 25,000 votes, lost his own seat by more than 4,000 votes. AAP still managed a healthy 44% votes, but that’s 9 percentage points lower than the previous assembly polls.Journalist Ashutosh, formerly a prominent member of AAP, says that two things massively damaged Kejriwal’s image: the 2022 liquor case and the CM bungalow controversy. “Nobody expected a man, who used to say that ministers and CMs should be living in two-room flats, to spend over Rs 40 crore on his own bungalow. Kejriwal entered politics hoping to change it. In stead, politics changed him,” he says.The multi-crore liquor case, which is still in court, led to Kejriwal spending five months in Tihar. These developments, says Ashutosh, caused Kejriwal to lose his moral aura in the last five years. “It was his calling card in the first three assembly elections, the reason for AAP’s massive victories in 2015 and 2020,” he says.Social commentator Santosh Desai, too, talks about the chipping away of the AAP leader’s personal aura due to the liquor case and the house renovation controversy. But he also adds that BJP stymied Kejriwal and his party from any meaningful local government action. “Their hands were tied and the room to manoeuvre was dramatically reduced,” he says.Desai also says that Kejriwal’s situation was akin to someone who, to stay politically relevant, reaches a place unrecognisable from the original point of his journey. “He may not be communal personally, but to neutralise the right wing, he started practising a version of it, so that the party is not vulnerable on that front. Kejriwal lost clarity on who he was and what he represented, enabling the BJP to maximise on the situation to its advantage. Put together, it created a situation where the public felt that Kejirwal was no longer the figure he once was,” he says.Free electricity (200 units), free water (20 kilolitres), improved govt schools, better functioning of govt hospitals (including free medicine) — Kejriwal created a positive playbook for freebies that exhilarated the lower-income classes, making them his dedicated constituency. AAP also offered free bus rides to women, but the deteriorating condition of Delhi’s roads and the unchecked pollution underlined that the party wasn’t paying enough attention to its core jobs and the city’s middle class.Desai says that AAP took its eyes off the ball, from its main calling card, which is taking civic governance seriously. “They were just living off what was done in their early years. After that, it became much more about retention of power,” he says.Political scientist Dipankar Gupta offers a fresh angle to the list of explanations. He says that AAP emerged out of a movement but, over the years, lost the “movement dimension” — participatory, enthusiastic and goal-oriented — of the party. “Without the ‘movement’ element, it lost its raison d’etre and became a competitor of the established parties. Structurally, AAP was never an administration-oriented party,” he says.Hilal Ahmed of CSDS offers a similar view. He avers that AAP had lost its ideological uniqueness even before this election. “The cadres or leaders associated with it were relying heavily on the success of the party over the years. After this defeat they might not find any attraction in the party or the figure of Kejriwal,” he says.So what next for Kejriwal?“He must find a new language for democracy, not just representation and election. Otherwise, he will remain caught up in the numerical pathology of the welfare state,” says social scientist Shiv Visvanathan. In other words, Kejriwal needs to reinvent his politics. The question is: does the street-fighter of the past have the stomach for a scrap in a hopelessly slanted battle?","Arvind kejriwal was an icon of hope for a new, fearless india.

""The fine is imposed on those who commit wrong.

He stressed that better enforcement of these laws could regulate the sector more effectively.Parameshwara acknowledged differences in approach but emphasised the need for a dedicated law.Karnataka government is now set to address the governor's concerns and resubmit the ordinance, keeping its objective of preventing borrower harassment intact.","Governor thaawar chand gehlot rejected karnataka micro finance (prevention of coercive actions) ordinance 2025.

How Jodhpur's restored stepwells are becoming cultural hubs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-jodhpurs-restored-stepwells-are-becoming-cultural-hubs/articleshow/118079874.cms,"OLD SPACE, NEW USE: Surface, an exhibition at Toorji ka Jhalra, uses the heritage setting dating back to the 1740s to showcase the country’s rich textile traditions

On a typical afternoon at Jodhpur's Toorji ka Jhalra , an ancient stepwell within the walled part of the old city, one can spot local teens flinging themselves off its intricately carved ledges before vanishing into the cool, green water below only to surface seconds later, grinning. A few steps away, a photographer trains his camera on a young couple against its ancient carvings while a weary tourist lounges on another step with his headphones on.Nearby, a sarangi player keeps passersby entertained with familiar Rajasthani folk tunes appropriated by Bollywood.Watching them, it's almost impossible to believe that this 18th-century relic was a dumping ground, buried under decades of stagnant water, not too long ago.Commissioned in the 1740s by Maharaja Abhaya Singh's queen, Toor, in keeping with the tradition of royal women patronising public waterworks, these cisterns - shaped like upside-down pyramids - were a lifeline in the desert. Persian wheels, powered by oxen, once hauled up water from their sandstone recesses. But with modern plumbing, they fell into disuse. Until now.Toorji ka Jhalra too seemed destined for the same fate until it got a second chance. Today, it stands restored at the heart of Stepwell Square, an Insta-friendly hotspot with high-end boutiques, artisanal cafes, and a chic heritage hotel flanking its steps.The transformation began with a casual conversation between brothers Dhananjaya and Nikhilendra Singh, cousins of the Maharaja of Jodhpur. Fresh off their success restoring an 18th-century Rajput mansion into the luxury boutique hotel Raas, they wondered: ""Why can't we rejuvenate the whole neighbourhood?"" The idea birthed the JDH Urban Regeneration Project, an initiative using design, technology, fashion and culture to revive Jodhpur's gullies, havelis, and bazaars for contemporary creative use.Over the past fortnight, Toorji ka Jhalra and the havelis surrounding it have played host to Surface, an exhibition where Jodhpur's centuries-old architecture is in quiet conversation with textile traditions, with embroidered textile installations stretched, draped, and suspended across alcoves of old havelis.At Achal Niwas, one of the first things that catch your eye is the mehrab - the classic arch motif seen all over Jodhpur. Textile designer Chinar Farooqui reinterprets it in thread, deconstructed into embroidered panels filled with clusters of smaller arches, floral patterns, and jali screens - each a fresh take on an architectural silhouette that defined such homes.Inside Anoop Singh ki Haveli - a still-lived-in space where the family gathers for evening aarti, a patchwork of textiles tell a cross-country story - quilts from Bihar and Bhuj Lambani (Banjara) embroidery revived by the Porgai Artisans Association in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and even an Australia-India collaboration where aboriginal artists and embroiderers from Bengaluru have woven ancestral stories across continents.Curator Mayank Singh Kaul sees Surface as part of a larger effort to take exhibitions beyond institutional or sterile white cube spaces into communities. ""I've done similar projects at an old govt school in a weaving village in Andhra Pradesh, repurposing three heritage homes in Hampi's Anegundi and the 125-year-old Lakshmi Mills in Coimbatore for a show on khadi,"" he says."" These exhibitions, he says, act as ""mobile libraries,"" bringing textile archives to regions where such resources don't exist. ""They become reference points for designers, artisans and students who otherwise have no access.""To understand the scale of Jodhpur's stepwell revival, one has to look beyond Toorji ka Jhalra. Across the city, multipronged efforts are on to reclaim these subterranean marvels. ""Stepwells weren't just water sources,"" explains Anu Mridul, a Jodhpur-based architect leading several of the city's stepwell restoration efforts. ""They were community spaces. Merchants traveling on spice or silk routes would rest here and within cities, they served as gathering spots for locals. Sadly, most of them were abandoned once piped water became the norm,"" says Mridul whose team has restored several stepwells including the 300-year-old Mayla Bagh and Naulakha Bawdi, with work now underway at Tapi Bawdi, one of Jodhpur's oldest stepwells.Cleaning up a stepwell is just the first step, says Dhananjaya Singh. ""If you don't find a meaningful way to use a restored space, it fades into obscurity again."" One way is by turning them into cultural hubs, like Toorji ka Jhalra. At Mayla Bagh ka Jhalra, a 150-ft-deep stepwell built in 1775-76, Mridul has partnered with the non-profit Scwedia Foundation to maintain the space, provide Wi-Fi, and host public events. On any given day, students study its stones and architecture, locals lounge and play cards while some even bring their laptops to work.Sauryansh Singh of Scwedia has been at it for six months now. ""We've cleaned it up, added ambient lighting along the jharokhas and steps and are now building a transparent stage over the water, so performers will literally be floating while the audience watches from the perimeter,"" he says. Later this month, Mayla ka Jhalra will host a three-day festival of music, dance and talks. ""It's fascinating how a centuries-old structure can still supply water and generate revenue for the community,"" adds Mridul.","The jdh urban regeneration project is using design, technology, fashion and culture to revive jodhpur's gullies, havelis, and bazaars for contemporary creative use.

Accreditation teams will now conduct evaluations entirely online, replacing on-campus visits with virtual assessments.For universities, though, the transition will be hybrid - most inspections will take place remotely, but a select number of reviewers will still visit campuses to maintain some level of direct oversight.The decision follows the recent Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrests in the case involving Andhra Pradesh-based Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation (KLEF), where members of the institution's management allegedly bribed NAAC peer visit inspectors to secure favourable ratings.""We decided to do all it takes to weed out elements of corruption. Cancelling physical visits will arrest the problem in a huge way,"" said NAAC executive committee chairman Prof Anil Sahasrabudhe. ""So many inspection visits take place every week, and it was very tough to monitor what transpired during these visits. Now, all this will be recorded.""NAAC director Ganesan Kannabiran called the shift to online inspection a ""surgical strike"" against corruption. ""NAAC's peer review system faced a challenging situation due to the recent CBI case. These are undesirable to the higher education system, and NAAC, being a quality assurance agency, is determined to eliminate such practices through definitive actions,"" he said.The long-anticipated basic (binary) accreditation model, recommended by the K Radhakrishnan Committee, was set for launch in July 2024 but did not take off. It has now been pushed to April-May 2025. The new timeline will also see the introduction of maturity-based graded levels (MBGL), a system designed to encourage institutions to enhance their academic and research capabilities. Special committees are finalising its framework.Around 650 institutions are in queue under the old grading system. Of these, nearly 50% are undergoing their second accreditation cycle and have been given the option to retain their current grade until the new system is in place. First-time applicants will have the choice to opt for the new basic accreditation model.

Delhi's Modi garden: BJP sweeps out AAP in big win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhis-modi-garden-bjp-sweeps-out-aap-in-big-win/articleshow/118079653.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi has once again proved that he can pull out big wins, this time by leading BJP to a historic victory in the Delhi assembly elections This triumph not only marks BJP's return to office in the Capital after a gap of 26 years, but it also shatters the ""myth"" that PM Modi's appeal is confined to national elections .The Delhi polls were seen as a litmus test for Modi's influence beyond the national stage as the saffron party didn't project any face and the PM was the sole mascot.His critics had long argued that while Modi could secure a landslide for BJP in national elections, his charm was less effective in state-level contests due to localised issues and regional identities. However, the results from Delhi tell a different story. BJP, under Modi's leadership, has not only won but has done so decisively, clinching 48 out of 70.Modi's campaign strategy in Delhi was multi-faceted, focusing on development, governance and a personal connection with the electorate. Unlike previous elections where regional leaders often took precedence, Modi himself became BJP's mascot for these polls.His rallies were not just about national achievements such as the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya or the abrogation of Article 370 but also addressed Delhi-specific issues like pollution, infrastructure gaps and the cleaning of Yamuna.This victory underscores Modi's ability to translate his national narrative into local victories, blending his overarching vision for India with the immediate needs of Delhi's residents. His speeches, particularly the one at the BJP headquarters post-victory, emphasised building Delhi as a ""modern city"" with a focus on urban infrastructure, mobility and heritage preservation, resonating with the urban voter's aspirations.The political narrative around Modi's electoral ""invincibility"" has been a subject of debate.In the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP under Modi swept all seven seats in Delhi, reinforcing his image as a national leader with strong voter appeal. However, the Delhi assembly elections of 2015 and 2020 saw AAP under Arvind Kejriwal clinch victories, fuelling the narrative that Modi's influence might not extend to regional politics. Saturday's result challenges that notion, showing that Modi's personal guarantees and BJP's campaign strategy can indeed sway voters at both levels.Moreover, this victory comes at a time when BJP's national popularity had shown signs of plateauing after the 2024 general elections, where it fell short of an outright majority.The Delhi win, coming close on the heels of Haryana and Maharashtra, is seen as a rejuvenation of Modi's political aura, proving that his leadership can still sway voters in regional contests.BJP's strategy also involved highlighting governance failures of AAP, especially when it came to allegations of corruption against its leaders, which played a significant role in swaying public opinion. Modi's promise to make Delhi a part of the 'Viksit Bharat' vision, aligning local governance with national development goals, was well-received.The Delhi outcome not only dispels the myth about Modi's limited regional appeal but also sets a precedent for how national leaders can engage with state politics. It's a testament to Modi's strategy of personal engagement, leveraging national success stories, and addressing local issues, making him a formidable","Pm narendra modi has once again proved that he can pull out big wins, this time by leading bjp to a historic victory in the delhi assembly elections.

Usually in such cases, the winning party asks one of its MLAs to vacate a relatively ‘safer’ seat for the chief minister, and then bypolls are held.Originating from an influential political family in Delhi, Parvesh Verma is the son of former BJP leader and Delhi chief minister Sahib Singh Verma.

NEW DELHI: Riding on the wave of recent successes in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections just a few months ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) registered a big win in the Delhi assembly elections. Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest.The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly.AAP , which had dominated the previous two terms with a substantial majority, managed only 22 seats. The Congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.The BJP and its NDA allies celebrated the Delhi win, attributing it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. The Congress, however, maintained that the results reflected a verdict on AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rather than Modi's governance.The Congress defended its decision to contest against Aam Aadmi Party, criticising those who questioned their stance. They pointed out that similar concerns about opposition unity were not raised when AAP contested elections in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana and other states, potentially dividing the secular vote.The BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept the Delhi assembly elections with a comfortable majority. This victory marks the third major electoral success for the BJP in the last four months after winning the states of Haryana and Maharashtra. With this, the 27 years exile of the BJP in Delhi also comes to an end. This major win also indicates approval by the middle class to Modi government’s big tax relief in the Union budget 2025 last week have got the approval of middle-class consumers.With this, PM Modi yet again proves to be the star campaigner for the BJP.In a high-stakes battle for New Delhi assembly seat, BJP leader Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant slayer by defeating former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by 4,089 seats.Son of former CM Sahib Singh Verma, Parvesh was was entrusted to take on Kejriwal who has held in to the seat last three times. In 2013, Kejriwal had emerged as giant slayer by defeating then CM and Congress veteran Sheila Dixit.After dethroning the three-time CM, Verma is also in now a strong contender for the top post.BJP leader Tarvinder Singh Marwah emerged as another giant slayer as he defeated former deputy CM and AAP senior leader Manish Sisodia. Marwah defeated three-time MLA Sisodia to win Jangpura seat by 675 votes. Sisodia had switched seats from Patparganj to Jangpura this time hoping for a comfortable win.Marwah, who was in Congress for a long time and elected three-time MLA from Jangpura, had switched to BJP in 2022 after complaining of not getting time with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for a meeting.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade As the heavyweights of Aam Aadmi Party fell one by one, Atishi stood tall and won the Kalkaji assembly seat. In a high-stakes contest, Atishi won by 3,521 votes defeating BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress's Alka Lamba.""I thank the people of Kalkaji for showing trust in me. I congratulate my team who worked against 'baahubal',"" Atishi said.""We accept the people's mandate. I have won but it's not a time to celebrate but continue the 'war' against the BJP,"" the 43-year-old said.Her victory is a standout for the AAP as its top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia lost their constituencies.With the defeat served to Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, Atishi may now also take charge as the leader of opposition in Delhi assembly.The Congress leader may have lost the contest today but he surely has emerged as the 'Baazigar' of this poll season. Son of veteran Congress leader and three-time CM Sheila Dikshit, Sandeep got his ultimate revenge against Arvind Kejriwal today.Though he did not win the New Delhi seat, he managed to eat in to Kejriwal's votes that eventually led to the AAP chief's defeat.It was a matter of prestige for Sandeep, who was finally given a ticket from New Delhi, his mother's bastion, which had been the stronghold of Kejriwal since 2013.It's no surprise there. The one at the top of this list is AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal. The politician, who rose to power as a anti-graft crusader found himself embroiled in corruption cases.After walking out of jail on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the top post seeking validation from the public of Delhi. The union territory, however, refused to give the stamp of 'Mr Clean' to Kejriwal.The AAP suffered a major blow this election and now will have to look at ways to reinvent itself.The former deputy chief minister of Delhi and second-in-command of AAP, Sisodia, also faced defeat against BJP candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah in the Jangpura constituency.Having previously served as a three-term MLA from Patparganj in east Delhi, he chose to contest from Jangpura in this election.Following his arrest in 2023 over alleged corruption in the liquor policy case, Sisodia was imprisoned for approximately 18 months until he secured bail. Similar to Kejriwal's stance, he declined to accept a governmental position prior to receiving the ""people's verdict"".Delhi, however, decided to give him another chance this time.After governing Delhi for a decade, AAP faced significant anti-incumbency and lost the election to BJP. This is the first time since its inception that AAP will not hold power in Delhi.With the Delhi loss, AAP is now in power only in Punjab. With this, the national expansion plan of the party has hit a roadblock.The party will now have to regroup and reorganise itself as it now sits in opposition in Delhi.The Congress party has recorded its third consecutive blank in the Delhi assembly elections, marking a stark contrast to its earlier dominance when it governed the capital for 15 consecutive years from 1998 to 2013.Delhi's electorate has consistently rejected the party in three successive assembly elections.After snapping alliance with AAP for Delhi elections , Congress mounted an assertive campaign with former party president Rahul Gandhi spearheading the criticism against Arvind Kejriwal.Despite these efforts, the party failed to secure any constituencies in Delhi. Their sole minor comfort lies in achieving a modest improvement in vote share, rising by approximately 2% from its previous figure of less than 5% in the 2020 assembly elections.Omar Abdullah’s X post captured the mood of INDIA bloc today -- 'Aur lado aapas mein'. The jibe came as AAP and Congress fought against each other which eventually benefitted BJP.With the bitter and ugly fight and AAP’s eventual loss in Delhi, the focus now turns to if it's an end to INDIA bloc.The AAP defeat also comes as an embarassment to Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party who actively campaigned for AAP in Delhi.While Congress may have not been able to open its account in Delhi once again, Rahul Gandhi cannot be put in the list of losers. Rahul, who personally took charge to dent Kejriwal's image during the election campaign, was successful in his mission.The defeat also limits AAP within the INDIA bloc who had the capability to challenge Congress' position as a national party. The Delhi blow also gives Congress a little immunity within the bloc where allies SP, TMC, Sena (UBT) chose Kejriwal's party over Congress.","The bjp secured a significant victory in delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly. Aam aadmi party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest. The congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118066812,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1558501,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal 's dream run in Delhi has come to an end. After two sweeping victories - in 2015 and 2020 - Kejriwal's AAP has been swept out of power in the 2025 assembly elections. The BJP has finally managed to breach Kejriwal's Delhi fortress to regain power after a gap of 27 years. The former Delhi chief minister, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, ran a very aggressive campaign against the BJP and also targeted the Congress.So, why did Kejriwal lose? Here's a look at some of the tricks that failed to click for the AAP chief.Arvind Kejriwal, who was out on bail in the excise policy case, resigned as chief minister of Delhi in September 2024, months ahead of elections to take a high moral ground on the issue of corruption.""I am ready for Agni Pariksha. Two days later, I will resign as chief minister. I will not sit on that chair till the people announce their verdict,"" Kejriwal had said at the time of resignation.Kejriwal, who had refused to resign even when he was in jail, eventually gave up his chair amid turmoil faced by him in the Delhi excise policy case. Several top leaders, including Kejriwal himself, faced accusations of accepting bribes from liquor companies in exchange for favorable policies. Eventually, several AAP leaders were jailed in connection with the case.Kejriwal's claim to fame in his first two terms was his transparent and pro-people governance model. The AAP chief claimed credit for transforming Delhi's government schools and his Mohalla clinics provided cheap medicare to the poor. In the 2020 elections, Kejriwal sought votes for his work and AAP campaign centred around the change it had brought to the lives of the people. However, this time around AAP's campaign was centred around its attacks on the BJP leadership and the Congress. Kejriwal, who along with top AAP leadership faced several corruption charges, focused less on development and governance narratives. He called BJP ""Gali Galauj Party.""In the middle of the campaign, Kejriwal dropped a bombshell as he accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna waters to kill people of Delhi. Kejriwal's charges gave a toxic turn to Delhi campaign with both BJP and Congress going all out against the AAP chief. At the end, as the results show - the people of Delhi were not swayed by his ""concerns"" for them.Arvind Kejriwal tried to woo the middle class by unveiling his party’s manifesto for them. He claimed that the middle class were ignored by successive governments and accused other political parties of treating them as ""just an ATM for the government"". Ironically though, Kejriwal's manifesto did not mention what he would do for the middle class if voted to power but only listed seven demands from the Centre to improve their lives. Little wonder, at the end the Centre's sops for the middle class in the Uunion Budget appealed more to Delhi voters than the AAP's demands.Confrontation has been a part of Kejriwal's politics right from the beginning. This time around it was no different. Right through his campaign, Kejriwal trained his guns at Delhi Police and the Election Commission. Kejriwal accused the Election Commission and Delhi Police of colluding with the BJP to subvert the electoral process and prevent AAP from campaigning. Kejriwal targeted Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and alleged that he ""wants a job post-retirement"" and was ""destroying the country"" for the post. Kejriwal's decision to take on the Congress along with the BJP boomeranged as on several seats, AAP's margin of defeat is less than the votes polled by the Congress candidate. Both Kejriwal and Rahul made relentless attacks against each other giving an opportunity to mock the allies-turned-rivals and take digs at opposition unity.",Kejriwal's dream run in delhi has come to an end. After two sweeping victories - in 2015 and 2020 - kejriwal's aap has been swept out of power in the 2025 assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Delhi has given its verdict and its 'ghar wapsi' for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after 27 years. According to the Election Commission, the BJP has 47 of a total of 70 seats in its bag. Arvind Kejriwal's AAP, which has ruled the union territory for a decade, managed to get only 23 seats.This marks the third major win for the BJP in the last four months after Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections.The Aam Aadmi Party, established in 2012, secured governance in Delhi in 2013 and had maintained its administrative control since 2015.The Kejriwal/Atishi government, however, failed to fight anti-incumbency. AAP's recognition of public dissatisfaction was evident in its selection of candidates.Despite making eleventh-hour alterations to the list, these changes proved insufficient to address the negative perception of certain MLAs, who were criticised for being unreachable and distant from their constituents.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Union budget gambit seems to have paid off as Delhi decided to give BJP a chance after 27 years. With a focus on the middle class, the Union finance minister announced a big tax relief to middle class just three days before the Delhi elections.Kejriwal's AAP had emerged from middle-class dissatisfaction with existing political systems but is now largely perceived as an organisation focused solely on underprivileged sections, offering benefits like complimentary electricity units and free transport for women.Also read: Winners and Losers of Delhi assembly election 2025 Although Kejriwal attempted to address middle class issues during his pre-election addresses, these efforts appeared insufficient and delayed.Since 2013, Kejriwal's AAP government has been able to establish 'Delhi model' in which it implemented several freebies/welfare schemes for the underprivileged. The BJP, however, did an Uno reverse on AAP in Delhi and announced several freebies and incentives.The BJP leadership, including PM Modi, while previously criticising welfare programmes as 'revadis', took a notably different stance in Delhi. They explicitly assured voters that all existing AAP government schemes would continue under BJP rule. The PM's personal guarantee on this matter carried significant authority and effectively countered AAP's assertions that BJP governance would deprive the underprivileged of their current benefits.The party, in its three-part manifesto, promised financial assistance of Rs 2,500 monthly to women from poor families under 'Mahila Samriddhi Yojana', LPG cylinders for Rs 500 to women from poor families, and one free cylinder each on Holi and Diwali.After years of blame-game by the Kejriwal government, it seems people of Delhi have had enough. This time, Delhi decided to go for a ""double-engine sarkaar"", which promises effective governance with the BJP government in the state and at the Centre.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade During the elections led by PM Modi, the BJP went all out to attack Kejriwal for non-governance in the last decade. Kejriwal, on the other hand, had time and again blamed the Centre and the LG for creating hurdles. The AAP also attributed the deteriorating road conditions and inadequate civic infrastructure to project delays caused by the LG.The voters appear to have concluded that a BJP-led government would operate more effectively with the Centre-appointed LG.A big credit for the BJP's win in Delhi could also be given to Rahul Gandhi. The Congress leader took upon himself to personally roast and attack Kejriwal.During the campaign, he singled out Kejriwal and even equated him with PM Modi, alleging that they were two sides of the same coin. Taking a direct jab at the AAP supremo, Rahul had said, “Arvind Kejriwal WagonR mein aaye, sweater pehne aur khambe pe chadh gaye. Phir khambe se utre aur seedha sheesh Mahal mein gaye (Arvind Kejriwal came in a small car—a WagonR—wearing a sweater and climbed an electric pole. After coming down, he went straight to the 'Sheesh Mahal' (glass palace) with automatic doors and big TVs)"".The AAP had secured governance by pledging to eliminate corruption in Delhi. The party's reputation, however, faced significant challenges due to the liquor policy controversy and various corruption allegations against its leadership.Prominent AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh have been at the centre of corruption charges.After getting out on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the CM post and gave the charge to Atishi. He had sought validation as 'Mr. Clean' from the voters. Delhi, however, decided to not give him another chance.In 2020, reducing Delhi air pollution was one of the 10 “guarantees of Kejriwal”. However, this year, “Kejriwal’s guarantee” did not mention pollution anywhere. In the last 10 years, the AAP government has pointed fingers at neighbouring states and refused to take responsibility for air pollution.The BJP, however, vowed to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 levels by half in the next five years.Targetting Kejriwal, BJP also promised to clean Yamuna water in the next five years.Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again proved to be the star campaigner for the BJP. Despite having no CM face in Delhi, BJP registers yet another win in assembly elections riding on PM Modi's popularity. During the election campaign, PM Modi personally took charge of targeting Arvind Kejriwal.True to his style, PM Modi started calling Kejriwal's party an 'AAPda' (disaster) for Delhi. He also took 'Farziwal' jibes at Kejriwal accusing him of being fake and corrupt.In fact, PM Modi also focused on attacking Kejriwal during his Lok Sabha speech a day before Delhi elections.During the Delhi assembly elections, the BJP tailored its message and underplayed Hindutva this time. Focussing on the anti-incumbency of Kejriwal, BJP focussed on governance and middle class.Much of the BJP campaign targetted Kejriwal who, along with Manish Sisodia, was jailed in a corruption case relating to a now-scrapped liquor policy over the past two years. The relentless focus on Kejriwal’s ""sheesh mahal"" may have also helped the BJP sway public opinion in favour of the party.The BJP's comprehensive campaign strategy amplified the demand for transformation in Delhi, capitalising on AAP leader Kejriwal's diminishing reputation amidst corruption allegations and perceived deviation from his original principles, particularly highlighted by the 'sheesh mahal' controversy.BJP officials managing different regions in the capital noted that their extensive 2020 campaign failed to gain traction because voters associated AAP's initial five-year tenure with positive developments in education, healthcare, and popular welfare schemes including complimentary bus travel for women and free electricity.The absence of significant corruption allegations during AAP's first term contrasted sharply with the present scenario, with BJP strategists noting that the ruling party had few achievements to highlight from their second term.""Out vote share grew significantly even in 2020 but there was no serious erosion in AAP's vote share. This time we succeeded in chipping away at its support base while keeping our votes intact,"" a BJP leader said.The BJP has won Delhi elections, but it also has Congress to thank. Congress and AAP, allies under INDIA bloc, decided to contest the Delhi assembly elections individually. During the campaign, both AAP and Congress accused each other of being the B team of the BJP.Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi opened a personal attack on Kejriwal while the AAP chief also left no stone unturned to discredit Congress. Eventually, though Congress was not able to open its account in Delhi, the Gandhis definitely dealt a big blow to the credibility of Kejriwal.","The aam aadmi party, established in 2012, secured governance in delhi in 2013 and had maintained its administrative control since 2015.

AAP’s setback and Kejriwal’s challenges



AAP’s uncertain future



A shifting political landscape



What lies ahead?



NEW DELHI: In 2013, with a pen in his pocket, a muffler around his neck, loose sweater and blue WagonR, Arvind Kejriwal embodied the ""aam aadmi"" when he entered public life. His decision to name his political party after the ""aam aadmi"" resonated strongly with the public.After twelve years, the aspirations of establishing a nationwide party and emerging as a national leader are diminishing for the civil servant-turned-activist who ventured into politics by establishing his own party rather than joining an existing one.The Aam Aadmi Party , which governed Delhi for 10 consecutive years and established a government in Punjab, suffered defeat in the capital city's election on Saturday, securing 22 seats whilst the BJP won 48.In his statement, Kejriwal assured that AAP members would continue their social work, emphasising that politics was only a means to serve the people. However, his political future remains uncertain.Kejriwal’s loss after a decade in power, coupled with the defeat of several AAP heavyweights, raises crucial questions about the party’s governance, strategy, and long-term vision. The AAP, which once held a brute majority in the Delhi assembly, now faces an existential crisis, struggling to maintain its relevance.Adding to Kejriwal’s woes are multiple legal battles. He was jailed on corruption charges related to the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy and is currently out on bail. With ongoing investigations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Kejriwal’s legal troubles are far from over. If convicted in the money laundering case, he could face a minimum of seven years in prison.Moreover, the Haryana government has filed a case against Kejriwal under the Disaster Management Act over his statement about ""poison"" in Yamuna water from Haryana. These legal entanglements make his political comeback even more challenging.Following the Delhi loss, AAP’s influence has been significantly curtailed. The party remains in power only in Punjab, and its expansion efforts in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Goa have yielded little success. With the party now leaderless in the Delhi assembly and its national ambitions derailed, AAP is at a crossroads.For Kejriwal, the road ahead may require a return to his roots—street-style activism, which first propelled him to prominence during the Anna Hazare movement. However, his biggest challenge will be keeping his party intact. AAP, once a force driven by volunteers and grassroots support, now risks fragmentation in the absence of political power.Nationally, Congress may see AAP’s weakening as an opportunity to reclaim lost ground in Delhi and beyond. Kejriwal’s diminished political standing could also make him a less favored ally among opposition parties, further isolating him in national politics.Speculation is already rife about Kejriwal potentially shifting focus to Punjab, where AAP still holds power. However, such a move could trigger further instability within the party and raise questions about its leadership structure.Kejriwal’s immediate focus will likely be on his legal battles. His political fate hinges on whether he can clear his name and rebuild his credibility. Meanwhile, AAP must reassess its strategies and find a way to stay relevant in the evolving political landscape.For now, both Kejriwal and AAP face their most challenging phase yet—navigating a period of political uncertainty, internal churn, and legal hurdles that could define their future trajectory.","The aam aadmi party, which governed delhi for 10 consecutive years, suffered defeat in the capital city's election on saturday. Kejriwal assured that aap members would continue their social work, emphasising that politics was only a means to serve the people.

Now the People of Delhi will receive the benefits of Double Engine Govt in the National Capital as Mr Farziwal has been swept out of power,"" Adhikari posted on X.The Bengal BJP unit also hailed the party's good performance in the Delhi polls, terming it a rejection of corruption and nepotism, while the TMC, which had backed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), maintained silence on the outcome.State BJP chief and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar said the verdict in Delhi reflected people's faith in development and would serve as a morale booster for party workers in West Bengal ahead of next year's assembly elections.The BJP is poised to form a government in Delhi after more than 26 years, with the latest Election Commission trends showing the saffron party ahead in 45 of the 70 assembly seats and AAP in 21 seats.""The people of Bengal will also vote for the BJP in the next assembly polls and reject the TMC,"" Majumdar told news agency.The 2021 West Bengal assembly election resulted in a decisive victory for the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, securing 213 out of 294 seats.

The Bharatiya Janata Party, which was struggling to even get double-digits in seat share in the past two assembly polls, won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats. Breaking the 27-year jinx, the BJP is again coming back to form the government in the national capital with the promise of development and good governance.The Aam Aadmi Party's defeat this time around has shown that freebie politics cannot hold its sheen for long if not coupled with on-the-ground development and infrastructure improvement.In this year's assembly election, BJP and Congress both followed the AAP's manifestos giving free electricity, water and bus services for women and even financial aid. This seemed like a freebies vs freebies contest where the BJP's advantage stemmed from two factors: voters' assessment of implementation records, with the BJP's performance in Madhya Pradesh outweighing AAP's shortcomings in Punjab; and the understanding that welfare schemes must be complemented by good governance.Reiterating the BJP's strategy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the party's historic win in Delhi, stating that ""development and good governance"" had won.""Jana Shakti is paramount! Development wins, good governance triumphs. I bow to my dear sisters and brothers of Delhi for this resounding and historic mandate to @BJP4India. We are humbled and honoured to receive these blessings. It is our guarantee that we will leave no stone unturned in developing Delhi, improving the overall quality of life for the people and ensuring that Delhi has a prime role to play in building a Viksit Bharat,"" he said in a tweet.Freebies, though a good strategy in the short term, failed to get votes for AAP this time. There was a lack of infrastructural development that raised questions among voters regarding AAP and its effectiveness in governance. In Delhi, AAP had promised to give clean tap water but there were many areas where the people didn't even have access to tap water. Long queues behind water tankers were a common sight across the city.For this year's elections, Kejriwal also promised to give financial support to priests, sparking a debate over whether the party's ideology revovled merely around ""revdi"" politics.In the last two elections, the AAP's main strong point was Mohalla clinics and municipal schools but one cannot fight only on the basis of these two pillars. Delhiites were looking for more evidence of developmental works that AAP had done in the last decade, and the party came up short.Another factor that lent itself to AAP's defeat was its frequent run-ins with the Lt Governor's office. Considering Delhi's governance structure under the National Capital Territory Act, the constant bickering created an impression of administrative inefficiency by AAP.Kejriwal's decision to retain his CM position whilst in custody over the excise policy scam case appeared to convince voters that administrative efficiency was being compromised for political advantage.This also resulted in postponed Cabinet sessions and administrative standstill. Saturday's results suggest that stepping down in March 2024 and maintaining ethical standards would have been a more prudent political strategy.",The bharatiya janata party won the election by securing a whopping 48 of 70 seats.

First Congress lost allies, then votes



Had the outcome been different if INDIA bloc contested together?



NEW DELHI: In the bustling newsrooms, as vote counting began for the Delhi elections, two names dominated the airwaves: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Conspicuously absent from the conversation was the Congress party – once the dominant force in Delhi's political landscape. As the day went by, the only thing that remained constant was the grand old party's score on the scoreboard - zero.The Congress party, which ruled Delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, went through a fourth consecutive defeat, ""humbly"" accepting the mandate as it had no other choice.""We humbly accept the mandate of Delhi. Heartfelt thanks to all Congress workers for their dedication and to all voters for their support. The fight for Delhi’s progress and the rights of Delhiites—against pollution, inflation, and corruption—will continue,"" the party leader Rahul Gandhi said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his victory speech said that the Congress ""drowns and takes down its allies with it"".Political analysts have often wondered if it's the Congress that's the weak link in INDIA bloc or is it the only pan India uniting force.When outcomes are analysed, INDIA bloc has lost crucial battles since it came into existence- Lok Sabha elections and Maharashtra. However, on the other side, it did secure victory in the politically crucial poll battle of Jammu and Kashmir- but the Congress could only manage six seats, leaving the National Conference as the largest party.Likewise, the opposition bloc swept the Jharkhand polls with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leading the way with 34 seats. Congress could win only 16.What's noticeable here is that the INDIA bloc has always won where the regional parties have taken the steering wheel.States where the opposition bloc did not contest together- Haryana & Delhi- did end up becoming each other's vote cutters, paving a smooth way for the BJP.The story of Congress's downfall in this election began well before the first vote was cast. The fractures within the INDIA bloc, a coalition of opposition parties, became apparent when heavyweight leaders like Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav chose to back AAP's Arvind Kejriwal instead of their supposed ally, Congress.""It feels like the BJP government will be formed,"" admitted Congress candidate Sandeep Dikshit from the New Delhi constituency, his words reflecting the party's diminishing expectations. The exit polls had already predicted this outcome, with most projections pointing to a clear BJP victory.Rahul Gandhi during the poll campaigns led a fierce attack on AAP, targeting Kejriwal over corruption allegations, while Kejriwal hit back, raising the National Herald case against Rahul.Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah criticized INDIA bloc allies AAP and Congress for contesting as rivals in the Delhi elections, as trends indicated significant gains for the BJP.""Aur lado aapas mein (fight more), "" Omar said reacting to trends.The results raised an inevitable question: Could the outcome have been different if the INDIA bloc had maintained unity? Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut seemed to think so, suggesting that a combined opposition could have secured victory against the BJP within the first hour of counting.""The early trends show a sharp competition. Had Congress and AAP been together, the results may have been different. The political opponent of AAP and Congress is BJP. Both of them fought to keep BJP from coming to power, but they fought individually. If they had been together then BJP's defeat must have been confirmed in the first hour (of counting),"" Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said.The division of opposition votes, a phenomenon also witnessed in the Haryana assembly elections, appeared to play directly into the BJP's hands. The very alliance that was formed to unite the opposition against the BJP ended up exemplifying its disunity.As Delhi's political landscape continues to evolve, the Congress party struggles to stay relevant. The party that once commanded the capital's political narrative now finds itself searching for relevance in a city it once called its own.","The congress party, which ruled delhi for 15 years on the trot from 1998 to 2013, went through a fourth consecutive defeat. The fractures within the india bloc, a coalition of opposition parties, became apparent when heavyweight leaders like mamata banerjee and akhilesh yadav chose to back aap's arvind kejriwal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118058557,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-915283,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party 's (AAP) loss in the Delhi assembly elections has sparked speculation about its political clout in Punjab, with opposition leaders in the state predicting a similar downfall.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a decisive victory in Delhi, reclaiming power after 26 years and dealing a severe blow to Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP, whose senior leadership struggled to hold ground.This marks the second major setback for AAP following the 2024 Lok Sabha elections , in which the party secured only three of the 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab.In contrast, AAP had secured a sweeping victory in the 2022 Punjab assembly elections, winning 92 out of 117 seats.Before the Delhi polls, Punjab's AAP unit, including chief minister Bhagwant Mann , cabinet ministers, MPs, and MLAs, actively campaigned in the national capital.Mann, as the party’s key campaigner, conducted roadshows and highlighted the achievements of his government, such as providing 50,000 government jobs, offering 300 units of free electricity, setting up 850 'mohalla clinics,' and acquiring a private thermal power plant.With AAP now governing only Punjab, opposition parties in the state strongly criticised the party, asserting that the Delhi electorate has exposed its ""lies and deceit"".""It is a defeat of Arvind Kejriwal's lies, deceit and dishonesty. People of Delhi today showed that you cannot rule the state for long by making false promises,"" Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma told news agency PTI.He further claimed that AAP's governance had left Delhi in a ""miserable"" condition and warned that Punjab’s AAP leaders would face an even worse fate.Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa predicted internal strife within AAP’s Punjab unit, claiming, ""There would be an internal power struggle between Bhagwant Mann and Arvind Kejriwal.""He blamed the Delhi defeat on corruption, inefficiency, and arrogance within AAP's leadership.BJP leader Preneet Kaur expressed satisfaction over her party's victory, adding that AAP’s much-touted ""Delhi model"" failed to deliver on its promises.""We have seen that their ""Aam Aadmi clinics"" did not work here. What they had promised, they did not keep them,"" she said.Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira described the outcome as a setback for ""fake revolutionaries"" who had failed to uphold their commitments on issues like VIP culture, Lokpal, Swaraj, and corruption.Punjab BJP vice president and former MLA Arvind Khanna called the Delhi mandate a rejection of AAP’s governance model, arguing that it signalled ""the beginning of AAP's downfall in Punjab as well"".He emphasized that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, India had experienced significant progress, making it crucial for Punjab to embrace BJP for real development.Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu echoed similar sentiments on X, posting, ""History rewritten in Delhi! After 27 years, the people have given BJP a resounding mandate, embracing PM @narendramodi's vision of Viksit Bharat. This victory is a testament to trust, development, and a brighter future. Thank you, Delhi.""He further accused AAP of harbouring ""the most corrupt leaders"" and suggested that the party’s downfall in Punjab was imminent.With AAP facing a critical juncture, its future in Punjab remains uncertain as political opponents ramp up their attacks, sensing an opportunity to weaken the party’s hold on the state.","The bharatiya janata party (bjp) secured a decisive victory in delhi, reclaiming power after 26 years. This marks the second major setback for aap following the 2024 lok sabha elections, in which the party secured only three of the 13 parliamentary seats in punjab.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118070227,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-107960,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In Delhi, where Congress ruled for 15 years a decade ago, it has not won a single seat in the 6 elections held since 2014,"" Shah said.""In this assembly election, Congress’s security deposit was forfeited in 67 out of 70 seats.

The elections were largely seen as a bipolar contest between the AAP, which made a determined bid for a fourth term, and the BJP. While the AAP had 62 members in the outgoing house, the saffron party had just eight legislators.","Amit shah takes a potshot at the grand-old-party in a social media post.

The only small consolation for the party is perhaps the nearly 2% increase in its vote share - which had gone down to under 5% in the 2020 assembly elections.The Congress's Delhi decline started in 2013, when the party lost power and was reduced to 8 seats with 11.4% vote share. The AAP gained at Congress's expense and won 28 seats with a vote share of 40%. In the 2015 assembly elections, the Congress could not win any seat and its vote share reduced to 9.7%.

Exit polls: A mixed track record for AAP



2013: Exit polls predicted 17 seats for AAP; the party won 28.

Exit polls predicted a comfortable majority for the NDA, forecasting between 240 to 275 seats. However, the actual results surprised many, with the NDA securing only 187 seats. Contrary to predictions, Congress and its allies won 216 seats.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls have frequently missed the mark in recent elections. In the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, they overestimated the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) performance, while in the Haryana assembly election, they incorrectly projected a tilt towards Congress. Predictions also varied widely across states. However, in the Delhi assembly election, exit polls were notably accurate, closely aligning with the actual results.On the counting day, the BJP secured 48 seats, while the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 22 seats displaying its worst performance since 2013.While most exit polls correctly predicted a BJP victory, their estimates for AAP varied significantly.Exit polls broadly captured BJP's lead, though many overestimated AAP's tally, reflecting the inconsistencies that have plagued past election predictions.Based on the Delhi election results (BJP: 48, AAP: 22, Congress: 0), P-Marq emerged as the most accurate, predicting AAP at 26 and BJP at 44, with a deviation of just four seats for both parties. Poll Diary followed closely, precisely forecasting AAP’s 22 seats and coming within two seats for BJP, though it slightly overestimated Congress.Axis My India also performed well, underestimating AAP by just two seats and missing BJP’s tally by the same margin, making it one of the more reliable projections for the BJP.Chanakya Strategies and People’s Insight had a six-seat deviation for BJP and a five-seat deviation for AAP, making them relatively accurate but not the best. Similarly, JVC Poll showed a comparable margin of error.Further down the accuracy rankings, MATRIZE significantly overestimated AAP’s strength (35 seats, 13 more than actual) while underestimating BJP’s performance (38 seats, 10 fewer than actual). DV Research followed a similar pattern, overestimating AAP by eight seats and underestimating BJP by the same number.The Poll of Polls compilation had a four-seat error for AAP and a five-seat error for BJP, placing it in the middle of the accuracy rankings. Peoples Pulse-Codema was significantly off, underestimating AAP by seven seats and overestimating BJP by eight seats. However, WEPRESIDE was the least accurate of all, overestimating AAP by a massive 27 seats while underestimating BJP by the same margin, making it the most incorrect prediction overall.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade AAP leaders dismissed the projections before the results were announced, citing historical inaccuracies. Party spokesperson Reena Gupta pointed out that in 2013, 2015, and 2020, exit polls had consistently underestimated AAP’s performance. Sanjay Singh went further, mockingly calling them ""surveys by massage and spa companies.""However, this time, exit polls were closer to reality, with BJP securing more seats than projected and AAP underperforming.Exit polls also stumbled in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The poll of polls had forecast 369 seats for the BJP-led NDA, but the actual tally was significantly lower. Similarly, in Maharashtra, agencies projected a clear Mahayuti (BJP-Shiv Sena-Ajit Pawar NCP) victory, though the seat range varied widely.Exit polls since 2004 have underperformed and were inaccurate at some of the important elections also including 2004 and 2024 Lok Sabha elections.
