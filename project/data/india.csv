NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday wrote a letter to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi , informing him that he has directed his legal team to begin drafting the Rohith Vemula Act - legislation aimed at curbing caste-based discrimination in educational institutions .The announcement comes after Siddaramaiah’s statement on Friday, affirming his government's commitment to enacting the law at the earliest. This came after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi urged the Karnataka government to introduce the Act, citing the need to eliminate caste discrimination in education.In his letter, Siddaramaiah responded to Gandhi’s April 16 message that referenced an incident faced by Dr BR Ambedkar. ""The reference in your letter dated 16th April 2025, to the incident faced by Dr B R Ambedkar, as narrated by him is indeed a sad reality even to this day.

""The murder of bright young people like Rohith Vemula, Payal Tadvi and Darshan Solanki is simply not acceptable. It is time to put a firm end to this.

Indi-Chini boys in US mount legal challenge against MAGA strike on foreign students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indi-chini-boys-in-us-mount-legal-challenge-against-maga-strike-on-foreign-students-f1-visa-termination-us-trump/articleshow/120437509.cms,"Image credit: AP

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

A group of three Indian and two Chinese students on Friday mounted a legal challenge against the Trump administration for disrupting the academic pursuit of hundreds of foreign students and academics in the US, often on minor grounds such as traffic and parking violations.In a class action lawsuit filed before the US District Court in New Hampshire, the five students, through their attorneys, alleged that the Department of Homeland Security has unilaterally terminated F-1 student status of ""hundreds, if not thousands,"" of foreign students and Optional Practical Training (“OPT”) participants throughout the US. They sought reinstatement of student visas that have been terminated, including theirs, and a halt to detentions and deportations.The three Indian plaintiffs Manikanta Pasula, Likhith Babu Gorrela, Thanuj Kumar Gummadavelli, are students at Rivier University in New Hampshire, and the two Chinese plaintiffs Hangrui Zhang and Haoyang An, are graduate students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. Indians and Chinese the two largest foreign groups in the US academia, with more than half million students between them.In the lawsuit, Pasula, now in the third semester of a computer engineering master's program, described being arrested and charged with driving without a valid US license while he had his Indian driver’s license. New Hampshire permits the use of an International Driving Permit for up to 60 days after foreign student’s arrival in the United States, and while Pasula was driving within that 60-day window, he pled guilty, paid a $248 fine, and immediately obtained a valid U.S. driver’s license.Earlier this month, Pasula received an email from Rivier University that the State Department revoked his visa. He separately received an email from the U.S. Consulate General, Mumbai, that confirmed that his visa was revoked and that “remaining in the United States without a lawful immigration status can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation.”The two other cases involving Indian students are similar. Thanuj was charged with speeding and a traffic misdemeanor for failing to carry a valid US driver’s license. Although he had a valid international driving permit at the time, he was outside the 60-day window in which the international driving permit is allowed in New Hampshire. Gorrela too had an international driving permit but was using it beyond the 60-day window. Although both paid fines and subsequently got their US licenses, the DHS nixed their student status, putting them on track for visa revocation and deportation.Of the two Chinese students, the lawsuit says Haoyang was charged with a misdemeanor for driving without an active insurance policy in Massachusetts, and Hangrui was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor in an episode stemming from a misunderstanding. Although both cases were subsequently dismissed in court, their student status was also revoked in the DHS crackdown that now extends to infractions that go far beyond political activism.Attorneys for the students said the Trump administration's ""unilateral and unlawful terminations"" have severely disrupted the educational opportunities of students who are in the middle of their studies (and in the middle of a semester) and who are simply trying to obtain, often at considerable expense, an education in the US while following all the rules required of them.""These injuries are real.... Their graduation is unpredictable and unlikely unless this Court intervenes,"" the lawsuit said, describing the students' situation. Linkhith Babu Gorrela’s graduation date for his Master’s program is May 20, 2025, and without a valid F-1 student status, he may not obtain his Master’s degree. Nor can he participate in the OPT program after graduation.Similarly, Thanuj Kumar Gummadavelli and Manikanta Pasula have only one semester left before they can complete their Master’s degrees and participate in the OPT program. Hangrui Zhang’s only source of income, the lawsuit said, is his research assistantship which has been cut off in light of the termination of his F-1 student status. Haoyang An will have to abandon his Master’s program despite having already invested $329,196 in his education in the US.","Group of three indian and two chinese students mount a legal challenge against the trump administration.

'I've put an end to all fights': Uddhav says open to joining hands with Raj Thackeray,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ive-put-end-to-all-fights-uddhav-says-open-to-join-hands-with-raj-thackeray/articleshow/120429555.cms,"Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray (File photos)

NEW DELHI: In what could be another dramatic churn in Maharashtra politics , Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday expressed willingness for a political tie-up with his estranged cousin Raj Thackeray Uddhav Thackeray's remark suggesting thaw with his brother, who parted ways and formed his own Maharashtra Navnirman Sena party, comes when the election at India's biggest municipal body, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), is due to be held this year.""I am ready to come together (with Raj Thackeray). I am ready to come forward in the interest of Maharashtra, keeping aside minor incidents. I have put an end to all fights. The interest of Maharashtra is my priority,"" Uddhav Thackeray, who is also Maharashtra's former CM, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI during his address at the 57th annual general meeting of Bharatiya Kamgar Sena.Raj Thackeray echoed a similar sentiment, saying that ""coming together is not difficult"" and that differences between cousins are ""proving costly for the existence of Maharashtra and Marathi people"".""The disputes and fights between Uddhav and me are minor -- Maharashtra is much bigger than all that. These differences are proving costly for the existence of Maharashtra and the Marathi people,"" Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency IANS.He further said: ""Coming together is not difficult, it’s a matter of will. It’s not just about my desire or selfishness. We need to look at the bigger picture. All Marathi people across political parties should unite and form a single party.""The MNS chief further distinguished his past political decisions from the Eknath Shinde-led rebellion, saying: ""I left Shiv Sena when MLAs and MPs were with me. Even then, I chose to walk alone because I couldn't work under anyone except Balasaheb Thackeray. I had no objection to working with Uddhav. The question is -- does the other side have the will to work with me?""“If Maharashtra wants us to come together, let Maharashtra speak up. I don’t let my ego get in the way of such matters,” he added.Uddhav Thackeray’s move to ride the new political wagon comes at a time when the Maha Vikas Aghadi , formed to counter the BJP, has been reeling from a crisis ever since its humiliating loss in the Maharashtra assembly elections last year.Raj Thackeray and Uddhav Thackeray, two key figures in Maharashtra politics, share a long and complex history shaped by the towering legacy of the late Bal Thackeray , their uncle and father, respectively, who founded the Shiv Sena. Their political journeys, once aligned under the same saffron banner, gradually diverged into rivalry and competing visions.While both were groomed in the party’s ranks, Raj was long seen as the natural heir due to his oratory style and aggressive street politics that mirrored Bal Thackeray’s persona. However, in the early 2000s, Balasaheb chose Uddhav, his quieter and more organisationally minded son, to lead the party, ""sidelining"" Raj.This decision created a rift, culminating in Raj’s exit from Shiv Sena in 2005.He soon launched his own party, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), with a similar pro-Marathi ideology, but it failed to match the dominance of the original Sena. Since then, Raj and Uddhav have often found themselves on opposing sides of Maharashtra’s political battles, with sporadic talk of reconciliation but no real unity.While Uddhav led Shiv Sena into an alliance with ideologically divergent parties like the Congress and NCP under the MVA to keep the BJP out of power, Raj oscillated between supporting the BJP and positioning himself as an independent force, often attempting to reclaim his relevance through hardline rhetoric against Hindi and north Indian migrant workers in Mumbai or issue-based campaigns.Their relationship today remains politically distant, shaped more by competition and legacy than by family ties.","Shiv sena chief uddhav thackeray expresses willingness for political tie-up with his estranged cousin raj thackerays.

'horrific and unacceptable': NCW

NEW DELHI: BJP leader Amit Malviya on Saturday claimed that Hindu families in West Bengal's Murshidabad district were systematically targeted during recent violence linked to protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.In a post on X, Malviya said that homes belonging to Hindu residents were marked with ink and kept under watch before being torched. He further alleged that two local Muslim residents helped attackers identify Hindu-owned houses and shops.""Shocking details emerging from Murshidabad! Before the arson attacks began, homes belonging to Hindu families were marked with ink and kept under close watch. After days of surveillance, these properties were systematically torched,"" Malviya wrote, adding that such targeted violence is reported to occur frequently, especially on Fridays.""Reports suggest that two local Muslim residents supplied key information to the attackers, helping them pinpoint Hindu-owned houses and shops. Disturbingly, similar targeted violence is said to occur regularly—particularly on Fridays,"" he added.The BJP IT cell head also accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of ""encouraging demographic change in border districts just to remain in power.""The incident that triggered these allegations occurred on April 11 during protests over the Waqf Act in Murshidabad, where a father-son duo — Harogobindo Das and Chandan Das — were found murdered with multiple stab wounds at their residence in the Jafrabad locality of Shamsherganj.Earlier today, West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose met the grieving family, assuring them of justice and support. ""I will look into your requests, There are three to four suggestions. They have asked for BSF postings in the locality. I will take up the matter with the appropriate authorities. Some proactive action will definitely be taken,"" he said, adding that the family has been provided the ‘Peace Room’ helpline number to reach out directly to Raj Bhavan.Many visuals showed the victims' family members breaking down in front of the governor, falling at his feet and pleading for justice. Later, after speaking with locals in Dhulian Bazar, Bose said, ""I have asked them (the victims) to feel free to talk to me. They want justice, and they will get justice.""The incident has also drawn strong condemnation from the National Commission for Women . Commission member Archana Majumdar, who visited the affected area, described the violence as ""horrific and unacceptable,"" urging the state government to take responsibility. ""Some woman lost their husband, some lost their son. People were dragged out of their homes and butchered. This is horrific. I don't know if such incidents have ever happened in West Bengal.

""The suffering these people are going through is inhuman. We will put their demands in front of the government,"" she said.Meanwhile, Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal staged protests across the country, including in Hyderabad, targeting the Mamata Banerjee-led government for its alleged inaction.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal accused the state government of allowing extremist forces to operate unchecked. ""We cannot let the country be on the verge of terrorism, and we will protect the Hindus from every danger. Mamata Banerjee herself acknowledged that foreign people were involved in the Murshidabad violence. If such is the case, was she sleeping? Why didn't she demand an NIA investigation?"" he said.Bansal further claimed that the Trinamool Congress government is acting against the interests of Hindus. ""We will remove this government of 'invaders'. Mamata Banerjee has been continuously supporting 'jihadis'. What the communist did earlier, she is doing now,"" he added.","Homes belonging to hindu residents were marked with ink and kept under watch before being torched.

Bengaluru/Shivamogga: The principal and a second-division clerk of a Bidar college were dismissed on Saturday after a student was allegedly barred from answering the Common Entrance Test (CET) maths paper for coming to the examination hall wearing a janivara (sacred thread).A district commissioner's report revealed that the exam staff at Bidar's Sai Spoorthi PU College had mistaken the janivara for a metallic accessory, leading to a misapplication of the CET dress code. The student was later allowed to write the biology paper in Thursday's afternoon session.A similar incident was reported in Shivamogga too following which two home guards have been booked under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), prompting statewide debate over the handling of religious symbols in exam halls. The report found college principal Chandrasekhara Biradara and inspection staffer Satish Pawar negligent.The chief invigilator, Moddasir, was also informed about the incident but failed to resolve the issue or notify KEA, the report added.Based on the findings, the departments of pre-university and higher education recommended their dismissal, which Sai Spoorthi PU College formalised. However, it remains unclear if the affected student will be given a re-exam. The matter is expected to be discussed with the chief minister, said sources.In a similar incident in Shivamogga, three students at Adichunchanagiri PU College were reportedly asked to remove their janivaras Wednesday. One student refused but was still allowed to take the exam, while two others complied. The matter came to light after a complaint by Natraj Bhagavath of Karnataka Brahmin Sabha.Police registered an FIR and two of the home guards involved were suspended.A senior police officer said that when questioned college authorities said they only provided the premises and had no role in conducting or facilitating the exams. They also stated that the staff did not ask students to remove their sacred threads, but only the Kashi dhara (sacred thread worn around the wrist).Deputy commissioner Gurudatta Hegde said CCTV footage did not show sacred threads being discarded in a dustbin, indicating the student may have removed it voluntarily. ""The issue stemmed from the security guards' poor judgment rather than any deliberate action against the sacred thread,"" he noted.Home minister G Parameshwara condemned the incident, saying, ""It is a grave mistake, and I can't accept such things.""In Hubballi, Union minister Pralhad Joshi termed the incident ""an attack on the Janivara belief"", calling for clearer instructions from the state.",Chief invigilator failed to notify kea: report.
