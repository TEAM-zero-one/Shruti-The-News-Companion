Tamil Nadu elections: EPS meets PM Modi at Trichy airport; first meet since AIADMK and BJP alliance renewed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-elections-eps-welcomes-pm-modi-at-trichy-airport-first-meet-since-aiadmk-and-bjp-alliance-renewed/articleshow/122930934.cms,"NEW DELHI: AIADMK General Secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) received Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Trichy airport on Saturday night. PM Modi is on a two-day visit to Tamil Nadu to launch various projects.Sharing the photos on X, PM Modi said, ""After the programme in Thoothukudi, landed in Tiruchirappalli to a warm welcome by various dignitaries. Looking forward to tomorrow’s programme at Gangaikonda Cholapuram. ""In the post, one picture sparked the question whether AIADMK and BJP is going to make alliance or not. EPS and PM Modi is meeting for the first time since the AIADMK and BJP renewed their alliance.The meeting came amid the war of words between the allies ahead of the 2026 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections. Earlier, EPS ruled out a coalition government with the BJP and said, “Our alliance would achieve a grand success in 2026. AIADMK will be victorious and will form a govt on its own.""This statement contradicts with Amit Shah's interview where he said that that the NDA led by the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu will form a coalition government.Recently, EPS reaffirmed that his party will form a government with an absolute majority in the upcoming assembly elections. ""Stalin claims that the DMK alliance will win 200 seats. Instead, the AIADMK alliance will win in 210 seats.AIADMK will form the govt with an absolute majority,"" he said.The ruling DMK has attacked the AIADMK for reviving ties with the BJP, saying that the saffron party would swallow EPS. EPS fired back and replied, ""Stalin says BJP will swallow Palaniswami. Is Palaniswami a worm to be swallowed by a fish? You are the one swallowing many of your allies. Congress has diminished, Communists have disappeared, and VCK is sticking around with DMK.""EPS also rebutted the criticism that AIADMK will be divided by BJP. ""Stalin is warning us that AIADMK will break and that I should be careful. I would like to tell him that AIADMK will not break,"" EPS said.The AIADMK and BJP came together for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. AIADMK walked out of the NDA in 2023, accusing Annamalai of insulting its leaders. After a bitter separation, the two parties came together on April 11.",Pm modi is on a two-day visit to tamil nadu to launch various projects.

"2006 Mumbai train blasts: It started in a jail cell. Now, it fights to free those wrongfully jailed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2006-mumbai-train-blasts-it-started-in-a-jail-cell-now-it-fights-to-free-those-wrongfully-jailed/articleshow/122930276.cms,"LONG BATTLE: Wahid Shaikh, who helped found the network, was acquitted in the case in 2015. Soon, his role shifted from accused to advocate

Besides its work on the 11/7 case, the Innocence Network India is helping other terror accused with legal aid

A narrow, rain-soaked lane in Mumbai’s Vikhroli leads to a small ground-floor room. Inside, a few chairs, a chatai, shelves of books, and maps of India and the world hang on the wall. This unassuming space is the ‘secretariat’ of Innocence Network India, a coalition of lawyers, prison-rights activists and civil society groups who work for “the rights of those wrongfully prosecuted or convicted, especially under terrorism charges.”On July 21, when the Bombay high court acquitted all 12 men convicted of the 2006 Mumbai train blasts — also known as the 11/7 bombings — some credit was due to this little-known coalition that kept the pressure alive, along with the efforts of the Maharashtra unit office of Jamiatul Ulema-e-Hind.Wahid Shaikh, who helped found the network, is visibly happy, and yet combative, seated in his two-room tenement. It’s where Shaikh, a school teacher in Nagpada, central Mumbai, spends most of his after-school hours running Acquit Undertrial, his one-man YouTube channel that amplifies cases of alleged wrongful prosecution and demands compensation for acquitted convicts. It was here that he recorded a congratulatory message for the accused and their families the night before the verdict.“I was 100% sure HC would exonerate them. I recorded it before the order was pronounced,” says Shaikh. He should know. He was one of 13 men arrested under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for the train blasts. He spent nine years in Arthur Road jail before being acquitted in 2015. The only one to walk free at the time.Soon after, his role shifted from accused to advocate. On the day the prosecution sought death for eight and life terms for four, Shaikh was in court filing applications to allow two of the accused — Ehtesham Siddiqui and Sajid Ansari — to appear for their LLB exams.That day, he said, “This is not the end of the road. There are more doors to knock on, and a longer way to go.” In the decade since, that road became his life’s work. Outside of his teaching job at a school in Nagpada, Shaikh has devoted himself to helping undertrials and families left waiting as years passed.His journey from accused to advocate began in jail. Inside the anda cell, he read 10 newspapers a day in four languages, filed dozens of RTIs, and helped other inmates prepare their defence. He earned an LLB, an MA in English, and wrote ‘Begunah Qaidi’, a 400-page Urdu memoir that was later translated into Hindi and English and adapted into a film.By 2016, less than two years after his own acquittal, Shaikh had formalised his work by founding the Innocence Network, a coalition of lawyers, retired judges, activists, and filmmakers committed to fighting wrongful arrests and prolonged incarceration. The collective organises seminars, people’s tribunals, and public campaigns for those caught in the crosshairs of terror cases. “Innocence Network is an NGO for the exonerees, by the exonerees and of the exonerees,” explains Shaikh, 48. He adds that many of the RTIs he filed from prison helped him and the other accused during trial.“We had to build our case from the inside,” he says. “That became the foundation for everything that followed.” The idea came from innocence projects across the globe. “Such networks by civil society groups exist in different countries. When we saw how many men were wrongly framed in terror cases and later acquitted by the courts as state failed to prove their culpability, we realised the need for such a network in India too,” says Sharib Aqleem Ali, co-founder and scholar-activist.Over the past eight years, Innocence Network has run mobile legal-aid clinics and awareness drives. But one of its most visible tools has been People’s Tribunal, a citizen-led public hearing that highlights stories the courts often overlook.At the first such tribunal in Delhi on Oct 2, 2016, chaired by retired Delhi high court Chief Justice A P Shah, around 15 acquitted individuals shared testimonies and filmmaker Saeed Mirza was among the eight-member jury whose recommendations later informed Law Commission’s Report No. 277.“One of those recommendations was that India ratify UN Convention Against Torture, which it has signed but never formally adopted,” says Delhi-based lawyer and network facilitator Fawaz Shaheen. Another key recommendation was repeal of Section 18 of MCOCA, which allows confessions made in police custody to be admissible, an issue central to the 11/7 trial.A second tribunal, held in Kolkata in 2017, heard testimonies from 20 more acquitted in terror cases. The network has also compiled a dossier based on letters written by the 11/7 accused from prison, and continues to file RTIs to uncover procedural lapses and custodial irregularities. Regular meetings are held by the coalition that runs on pro bono support with mentors like retired Bombay HC judge B G Kolse Patil.As for the blasts case, the legal fight isn’t over yet. Bombay HC order acquitting all 12 has been stayed by Supreme Court. And from this tiny room in Vikhroli, the battle continues.","Innocence network india is helping other terror accused with legal aid. Wahid shaikh, who helped found the network, was acquitted in the case in 2015. He was one of 13 men arrested under maharashtra control of organised crime act (mcoca) for the train blasts.

"Karnataka government geotags over 31,000 waterbodies in restoration effort",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-government-geotags-over-31000-waterbodies-in-restoration-effort/articleshow/122929870.cms,"BENGALURU: In a move to safeguard its water resources and protect lakes, the Karnataka govt launched a project involving the geotagging of lakes in March 2024. The project, taken up by the department of minor irrigation and groundwater development in collaboration with the department of survey, settlement and land records, seeks to geotag all 41,875 waterbodies in the state.As of April 2025, as many as 31,033 waterbodies were geotagged. Locals and panchayats are pitching in, turning conservation into a community mission. With this, the govt can track real-time updates, including water flow and encroachments.Till April, the state had surveyed and mapped 34,651 lakes spanning 7.7 lakh acres. In the process, it identified 42,678 acres of lake encroachment; of this, 28,750 acres have been cleared and restored, while the remaining are in the process of being recovered. Among the districts, Hassan has the highest number of geotagged waterbodies so far, while Ballari has the least. Community participation has played a key role in ensuring the project's progress, with gram panchayats helping in identifying lake boundaries, resolving local disputes and validating field data.Legal enforcement has also been made easier through geotagging. When encroachments are detected using data, the authorities concerned fine those responsible. The geotagged data is being used to support drought resilience and groundwater recharge planning, and aligns with the Karnataka State Action Plan on Climate Change, the Bengaluru Climate Action & Resilience Plan, and World Bank's water resilience project.Officials say this integrated approach will help the state strengthen flood-control measures, improve water storage, and secure the long-term water availability across the urban & rural areas across the state.","As of april 2025, as many as 31,033 waterbodies were geotagged.

AGRA: Rajveer Singh Yadav was never the man police meant to arrest. It was his brother Ramveer they wanted. But one clerical mistake - a swapped name - landed Rajveer behind bars for 22 days. While cops admitted to the error within weeks, the case dragged on for 17 years in court, wrecking his livelihood, his kids' education, and his peace of mind. Now at 55, Rajveer has finally been acquitted.A Mainpuri court on Saturday declared Rajveer Singh Yadav innocent and ordered action against the policemen whose ""gross negligence"" cost him nearly two decades of suffering.I kept insisting I wasn't the one. But they didn't listen. They just picked me up and sent me to jail,"" Rajveer, father of three daughters and a son, told TOI on Saturday. ""I fought the case for 17 years. At the time, no one even knew who had filed the case - they just saw my name and dragged me in. I couldn't work. I couldn't educate my children. I lost everything.""He added: ""I somehow managed to get my daughters married. My son had to drop out. We were destroyed. I just want the officers who did this to me to be held accountable.At the very least, I should be compensated for what I've gone through.""The case goes back to Aug 31, 2008, when Mainpuri police filed an FIR under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) and provisions of the SC/ST Act against four men, including Manoj Yadav, Pravesh Yadav, Bhola Yadav, and Ramveer Singh Yadav - all from Nagla Bhant village, Mainpuri - following a clash allegedly linked to an election dispute. The Gangster Act was added soon after.However, when the gang chart was prepared, the then SHO of Mainpuri Kotwali, Omprakash, made a critical error: instead of Ramveer, he listed Rajveer Singh Yadav - Ramveer's elder brother. The investigation was handed over to sub-inspector Shivsagar Dixit, the then SHO of Dannahar police station, Rajveer's lawyer Vinod Kumar Yadav said.On Dec 1 that year, Rajveer was arrested. From jail, he moved a plea before the special Gangster Act court in Agra, insisting that he had been wrongly named. The court summoned the officers concerned. On Dec 22, inspector Omprakash admitted before the judge that Rajveer's name had been ""added by mistake"". The court passed his release order the same day.Judge Mohammed Iqbal, who was then hearing Gangster Act cases, even wrote to the SSP of Mainpuri recommending disciplinary action against the erring cops. But despite the admission in court and the judge's warning, SI Shivsagar Dixit still filed a chargesheet against Rajveer - and the case continued.","Mainpuri court declares rajveer singh yadav innocent and orders action against the policemen whose ""gross negligence"" cost him nearly two decades of suffering.

Kiren Rijiju Rips Into Rahul Gandhi Over Remarks On Jaishankar-Xi Meeting In China

NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju shared an embarrassing yet unforgettable anecdote from his early days in politics, when his very first request to the Lok Sabha Speaker was for a “smoking room. ”Recalling his first meeting with Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, Kiren Rijiju said he walked out with a “good scolding” and a lasting lesson- to ""approach such offices with more purpose.""""The first time I met Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, I had gone to request a room for MPs who smoke.

That is politics, but we are not enemies.""""There, one MP represents approximately 66,000 people. Here, it is over 20 lakh. They are not asked to fix drains or get someone out of jail.

Poll What’s more important for restoring public trust in Bihar? Strict action against criminals Stronger political accountability

NEW DELHI: ""I feel ashamed that I am supporting a government where crime has become uncontrolled,"" said LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan on Saturday, stirring political waters with a pointed attack on Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar -- even as his party remains part of the BJP-led NDA. With elections in Bihar looming later this year, Chirag's blunt criticism has caused ripples within the ruling alliance.Addressing reporters, Chirag expressed anguish over the deteriorating law and order in Bihar. ""The way crime is happening in Bihar, the administration has totally bowed down in front of the criminals. It is correct that this incident required condemnation, but why such incidents are happening? There is a series of crimes. If it continues like this, the situation would be frightening, rather, it has become so...""He continued, ""If it is said that it is happening because of the election, I can also aver it might possibly be so, it might be a conspiracy to defame the government, but even then, it is the responsibility of the administration to control it. Either the administration is in collusion with it, or the administration has become completely useless, and now it is beyond their power to keep Bihar and Biharis safe.""""I request the Bihar government to take action on this matter in a timely manner. I feel ashamed that I am supporting such a government, under which crime has gotten out of control,"" Chirag added.Chirag's attack on the Nitish Kumar-led government comes in the wake of a series of disturbing crimes in Bihar. Most recently, a 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a moving ambulance after collapsing during a Home Guard recruitment drive in Gaya district. The incident took place on July 24 in Bodh Gaya, where candidates were undergoing a physical endurance test.His remarks also follow a spate of high-profile killings over the past month -- including the murder of gangster Chandan Mishra inside Patna’s Paras Hospital, the shooting of industrialist Gopal Khemka outside his residence, and the killings of sand trader Ramakant Yadav and grocery trader Vikram Jha in separate incidents.Meanwhile, another constituent of the NDA, HAM leader and Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, expressed concern over internal tensions within the alliance. He said, ""We are in NDA. We have to help NDA. We wish him all the best. He should strengthen the NDA. If he does not adopt the 2020 policy, it will be a very good thing. Because today NDA has become necessary for the society and the country. Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar are doing all kinds of development. If someone opposes NDA, then I think he does not have good feelings towards the people of the state and the country and if work is being done to strengthen it, then we will appreciate it...""The opposition Congress, a partner in the RJD-led alliance, shared the video of Chirag's criticism, indirectly targeting Nitish Kumar and highlighting cracks within the NDA camp.Still, brushing aside speculation of any rift, Chirag clarified that his party would not repeat the 2020 move of going solo. ""Our party considers all NDA candidates as their own, and we are ready to put in our entire effort to ensure their victory on all 243 seats in the state,"" he said.As Bihar moves closer to elections, the battle lines are clearly drawn. The NDA -- with BJP, JD(U), and LJP (RV) -- is preparing to face a united opposition led by RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, with backing from Congress and Left parties across all seats.",Ljp (ram vilas) chief chirag paswan stirs political waters with pointed attack on bihar chief minister nitish kumar.

NEW DELHI: The Agra and Uttarakhand police, in a joint effort, have arrested six individuals linked to the Chhangur gang, an international religious conversion racket operating out of Pakistan and Dubai. Confirming the arrests on Saturday, Dehradun senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ajay Singh also revealed how the accused, Chhangur Baba, tried to bypass the state's anti-conversion law by shifting the process to Delhi.SSP Singh said the Agra Police team had been in Uttarakhand for the last ten days as part of the investigation. He added that a case had been registered based on Mariyam's complaint, and another victim had also been identified during the investigation.""A team of Agra Police from UP came here 10 days ago in regard to a case. A man named Abdul Rehman was converted to Islam from Hinduism in 2014-15. When we investigated the case, we learnt about a victim whose converted name was Mariyam.

All the accused in the case were associated with a gang in Pakistan and Dubai.All six main accused in the case have been arrested by the Agra Police. The investigation is in a primary stage.

His arrest followed those of Chhangur Baba and his close aide Nasreen, believed to be the masterminds of the alleged syndicate.According to ADG (law and order) Amitabh Yash, the gang had been operating for over 15 years, using various methods including honey-trapping, exploiting minors, and administrative pressure to facilitate religious conversions.""A significant amount of foreign funding has been traced to the gang,"" he said, as reported by ANI. ""The syndicate used nearly 40 bank accounts and had different rate cards for various types of conversions. The ATS is tracking the sources of these funds.Yash added that properties acquired using illegal funds would be seized and demolished.""Chhangur Baba and his main associate, Neetu alias Nasreen, will be interrogated regarding their network, financial trail, and assets.

NEW DELHI: BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia on Saturday launched a sharp attack on Rahul Gandhi and the Congress, accusing it of repeatedly insulting the other backward classes (OBC) community, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who also belongs to the same category. He also branded Congress as the “most corrupt party” for idealising leaders facing scam allegations.Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Gaurav Bhatia said, ""The most corrupt party held a conference on the OBC society yesterday. Rahul Gandhi himself has always insulted the OBC community and the Prime Minister, who comes from the OBC community. There are many serious charges against him, including corruption, and he is out on bail.""The BJP leader also questioned Rahul Gandhi’s endorsement of leaders like Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and former Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, both of whom he claimed are facing corruption allegations.""Rahul Gandhi said that your ideals are sitting here. According to Rahul Gandhi, that ideal is Siddaramaiah, who is accused of the Muda scam. Bhupesh Baghel and his son are accused of many scams... The government has resolved to make the country corruption-free, but Rahul Gandhi says that those who are corrupt have the qualities to become leaders,"" he added, as quoted by ANI.The BJP’s remark came a day after the Congress organised the 'Bhagidari Nyay Sammelan' at Delhi’s Talkatora Stadium. The event was inaugurated by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and concluded with Rahul Gandhi's keynote address.During the event, Kharge reiterated the Congress party’s demand for a nationwide caste-based census and the removal of the 50 per cent cap on reservations. He also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of denying rights to backward communities and misleading the country.In his speech, Rahul Gandhi admitted that not conducting a caste census during the UPA government was a mistake and expressed his resolve to correct it. He said he had earlier failed to fully understand the issues faced by the OBC community, unlike those of Dalits, tribals, and women.""I think about my work, where I did well and where I fell short, and I see two to three things. Land Acquisition Bill, MNREGA, Right to Food, Tribal Bill, and Niyamgiri struggle- all these things I did well. As far as the issues of tribals, Dalits, and women are concerned, I should get good marks there. I did good work,"" he said, as quoted by ANI.Earlier in the day, Congress leader Udit Raj said that Rahul Gandhi will prove to be the ""second Ambedkar"" for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) if they listen to what he said during the Bhagidari Nyay Sammelan.Raj compared Rahul Gandhi to Babasaheb Ambedkar and said that the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) must support the statements made by the LoP.""Caste census in Telangana is an X-ray of society. Rahul Gandhi aims to replicate it nationwide. His views are visionary. If Dalits and backward classes come forward, our economy will boost. The inequality that prevails in society will be reduced. If OBC understands what Rahul Gandhi said, he will prove to be the second Ambedkar for them,"" Raj told ANI.""OBCs will have to think that history does not give opportunities for progress again and again. They should follow and support what Rahul Gandhi said in the Talkatora Stadium conference. If they do so, then Rahul Gandhi will prove to be the second Ambedkar for them,"" Raj posted on X.Responding to Udit Raj’s remarks, BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya accused Congress of hatching a conspiracy to diminish Ambedkar's legacy. ""Congress is now worried about finding another Ambedkar. But the country knows how Congress betrayed Dr Ambedkar and repeatedly insulted him, which is recorded in history,"" he wrote on X.Malviya also took a swipe at Rahul Gandhi and said he could ""never become anything, except a historic failure.""""The question is — why isn’t Congress searching for another Nehru?

NEW DELHI: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday criticised the detention and deportation of Bengali-speaking Muslim citizens across India, accusing the police administration of unfairly branding them as ""illegal immigrants. "" Taking a dig at the BJP-led central government, Owaisi alleged it was acting “strong with the weak"" by going after the country’s poorest communities.Taking to social media platform X, Owaisi claimed that those being labelled as illegal immigrants were repeatedly targeted because they lacked the means to challenge police atrocities.“There have been disturbing reports of Indian citizens being pushed into Bangladesh at gunpoint,” said Owaisi in his post.""Police in different parts of India have been illegally detaining Bengali-speaking Muslim citizens and accusing them of being Bangladeshi. This government acts strong with the weak, and weak with the strong.

""Police do not have the power to detain people just because they speak a particular language. These wide-net detentions are illegal,"" said Owaisi.The AIMIM chief’s statement came days after the Pune city police arrested five Bangladeshi women from the Budhwar Peth red-light area.
