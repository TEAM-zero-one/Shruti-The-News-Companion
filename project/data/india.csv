The process of collecting signatures from MPs to initiate the motion could begin shortly, he added.The govt is yet to decide whether the motion will be tabled in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. For the lower House, at least 100 MPs must endorse the proposal, while in the upper House, support from 50 MPs is required. Rijiju said the signatures will be gathered once a decision is taken on which House will take up the motion.The monsoon session of Parliament is scheduled from July 21 to Aug 21. Under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, once a motion for removal is admitted in either House, the presiding officer constitutes a three-member committee to examine the allegations. The panel comprises the Chief Justice of India (or a Supreme Court judge), a chief justice of a high court, and a distinguished jurist.The move comes months after a fire at Justice Varma's official residence led to discovery of sacks stuffed with charred cash in the outhouse.Though Justice Varma denied knowledge of the money, an SC-appointed panel found evidence against him after recording witness statements and his own deposition.Justice Varma, then serving in Delhi HC, was sent back to Allahabad HC, where he has not been assigned judicial work. Sources said former CJI Sanjiv Khanna had urged him to resign, but Justice Varma refused.

Centre's pick & choose policy hits HC judge appointments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centres-pick-choose-policy-hits-hc-judge-appointments/articleshow/122237031.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Advocate Ramaswamy Neelakandan prepared for life as a high court judge by returning case files to clients after the CJI-led Supreme Court collegium on Jan 17, 2023, recommended to Union govt to appoint him, along with four other advocates, including L C Victoria Gowri, as judges of Madras high court.The Union govt appointed all of them as judges, except Neelakandan. Though names of the five advocates were sent by the SC collegium on the same day, the govt appointed them in batches - three on Feb 7, 2023, and the fourth on Feb 27, 2023.Neelakandan, who belongs to the OBC community, shares his fate with 28 other advocates, whose names were recommended to the govt by the collegium between Jan 2023 and April this year. The Centre's pick and choose policy has left them in suspense - whether to resume practice or keep waiting for the Centre's nod to become an HC judge.While Neelakandan's wait has stretched beyond 29 months, advocate Subhash Upadhyay, whose name was recommended by collegium on April 12, 2023, for judgeship in Uttarakhand HC, is waiting for his warrant of appointment for the last 26 months.Along with Upadhyay, the collegium had recommended names of three advocates and a judicial officer for appointment as judges of the HC. Only Upadhyay's name was left out. Like him, advocate Arun Kumar is awaiting action on collegium's May 9, 2023, recommendation for his appointment as Allahabad HC judge.On Oct 17, 2023, the collegium recommended the names of five advocates for appointment as judges of Madhya Pradesh HC. Among them, only advocate Amit Seth is still awaiting appointment.Of the 29 advocates still awaiting appointment as HC judges, five are women advocates. Among them, the one enduring the longest wait is advocate Shamima Jahan, whose name was recommended by the collegium on Jan 4, 2024, for appointment as a judge of Gauhati HC.Other women advocates sharing Jahan's fate are Sreeja Vijayalakshmi (name recommended on April 16, 2024), Tajal Vashi (Oct 15, 2024; Gujarat HC), Shwetasree Majumder (Aug 21, 2024; Delhi HC), and Sheetal Mirdha (March 5, 2025; Rajasthan HC).Despite successive chief justices, including the incumbent CJI B R Gavai, impressing upon the Union govt not to pick and choose from the list and avoid making staggered appointments from the same batch, the govt has not abandoned the practice which creates seniority issues in constitutional courts where merit and seniority are two crucial factors for career advancement.Interestingly, the collegium's recommendations for appointment of judges to Supreme Court have been speedily processed and implemented by the govt, in some cases the appointments have come through within three days of the recommendation.The collegium recommended to the govt on May 26 to appoint Justices N V Anjaria, Vijay Bishnoi and A S Chandurkar as judges of the SC. The three took oath as Supreme Court judges on May 30.On May 26, the collegium recommended appointments of chief justices to five HCs, transfers of four HC CJs and transfer and repatriation of 22 HC judges.

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About

Poll Do you believe that marital pressure can lead to extreme actions such as murder? Yes, it can lead to drastic measures. No, there are always better alternatives.





AURANGABAD: In a chilling echo of the recent Meghalaya honeymoon murder, a 45-day-old marriage in Bihar’s Aurangabad district ended in bloodshed when a young woman allegedly conspired with her maternal uncle and his two accomplices to have her husband shot dead in cold blood.The victim, 24-year-old Priyanshu Kumar Singh, was murdered on the night of June 24 while returning from Nabinagar railway station.Initial probe suggested a contract killing, but the case took a dark turn when police found that the murder had been masterminded by Priyanshu’s own wife, Gunja Singh (30).According to Aurangabad Superintendent of Police Ambarish Rahul, Gunja had been in a 15-year-long illicit relationship with her maternal uncle, Jeevan Singh (52).Despite her reluctance, she married Priyanshu in May under family pressure. But just weeks into the marriage, struggling to keep her affair secret, she allegedly decided to eliminate her husband — inspired by the Meghalaya honeymoon murdercase, where a newlywed woman was accused of murdering her husband during their honeymoon trip.Police say Gunja and Jeevan plotted meticulously. Jeevan, with the help of Jaishankar Chaubey and Mukesh Sharma from Garhwa district, Jharkhand, arranged SIM cards and logistics to execute the plan.On the night of the murder, Priyanshu, returning from Varanasi, made a routine call to update his wife on his whereabouts. Gunja passed the information to the killers, who were lying in wait. Moments later, Priyanshu was ambushed and shot dead.Gunja was arrested on Wednesday evening, and during interrogation, she confessed to the murder conspiracy. Both accomplices have also been taken into custody, while her uncle Jeevan Singh remains absconding, with a manhunt underway.Police have seized Gunja’s mobile phone, and call records are expected to play a crucial role in proving her involvement.The chilling similarity to the Meghalaya honeymoon case — where marital intimacy masked a sinister murder plot — has left both investigators and locals stunned.","Priyanshu kumar singh, 24, was murdered on the night of june 24 while returning from nabinagar railway station.

Follow Procedure: Court





BENGALURU: Swapnil Nagesh Mali, the 30-year-old senior associate consultant at Infosys who was arrested, and later released on bail, for secretly filming one of his female colleagues inside their office washroom, has confessed to the police that he had secretly recorded at least one more woman in the company restroom.During interrogation, Swapnil said he derived ""satisfaction"" from watching such videos and had more than 50 such downloaded clips on his phone.Swapnil, a BE from Ram Nagar in Maharashtra's Sangli district, is the son of a farmer. Police said his parents were shocked and deeply disturbed when informed about his arrest.According to the victim's complaint, around 11 am on June 30, she went to the washroom. While using the toilet, she noticed a reflection on the cubicle door and saw someone attempting to pull something from the adjacent stall.She quickly stepped out and saw another woman exiting one of the other cubicles. To verify what exactly was the matter, she returned to the same stall that she had been to, climbed onto the commode and saw a man standing on the commode in the neighbouring cubicle and recording her. His trousers were off.As soon as she confronted him, the accused began apologising repeatedly. The victim then ran out and alerted her colleagues about the intruder in the women's washroom. Swapnil, who was trying to flee, was cornered and caught by housekeeping staff.According to the police, the victim and another female employee from the company's HR department checked Swapnil's phone, and found the victim's video clip in it. They took a screenshot of the clip as evidence and deleted it from the accused's phone to make sure it wasn't shared.However, according to a senior police officer, the videos were still on the phone as those had not been deleted permanently. ""Once we confirmed that the videos were still thereon his phone, a woman police sub-inspector was told to check those,"" the officer said.""After informing her company HR, the victim returned home and informed her husband about the incident, who advised her to file a police complaint so that legal action could be initiated,"" police said.Subsequently, the victim lodged a police complaint on July 1.When Electronics City police produced the accused in court, the magistrate noted that the sections invoked are punishable with less than seven years' imprisonment and directed police to follow proper arrest procedures and grant station bail.The magistrate also reminded the cops that even minor lapses could lead to the accused being acquitted.","Swapnil nagesh mali, 30, a senior associate consultant at infosys, was arrested for secretly filming one of his female colleagues inside their office washroom.

NEW DELHI: The man who allegedly raped a 22-year-old woman in her Pune flat left behind a chilling message threatening to leak her photos online and took a selfie using her phone before fleeing, police revealed on Thursday, as per PTI. The accused, who posed as a courier delivery executive to gain entry, remains at large nearly 24 hours after the attack.

Ram Krishan Singh's life reflected the horrors of communal violence as well as the courage and compassion that shone through despite the bloodshed.Ram Krishan was about 24-years-old during the division of India into two nations, which led to violent upheaval in Punjab. In Aug 1947, a mob murdered his father, Jeona Singh, a carpenter and bullockcart manufacturer, in Dhainthal after he refused to abandon their ancestral home.""My father was killed during those days of hate. Before Partition, our village was largely Muslim, with a few Sikh and Hindu families. Children played in each other's homes. Then, suddenly everything changed,"" Ram Krishan Singh had recalled in an interview with a web channel, Azad Bol Punjabi, four years ago.As communal tensions escalated, Ram Krishan and other family members temporarily fled to nearby Tullewal village. Jeona Singh stayed back to guard their home, along with an elderly Nihang. When Muslim families began migrating to Pakistan, a mob entered Dhainthal and killed Jeona in his home.Ram Krishan's grandson, Hardeep Singh Gahir, a assistant public relations officer in Patiala, said his grandfather went back in search of his father, only to face a grim reality.Gahir said, ""The Nihang who survived told my grandfather that he had to cremate Jeona in a tandoor using cow-dung cakes because there was no safe way to arrange a funeral.""During the strife, Ram Krishan's life was spared by an unexpected act of humanity. When he and other family members were cornered by an armed group, a Muslim villager intervened to protect him. This stranger's bravery became a story Ram Krishan frequently recounted. Gahir shared, ""Even in his last years, he would recall with gratitude how a Muslim man risked his own life to save him.""Following Partition, the family's life in Dhainthal changed permanently. Jeona's wife, who was pregnant at the time, gave birth to a daughter, Mohinder Kaur, two months after Partition. Ram Krishan delayed his own marriage until he was 30 as the family rebuilt their lives. He continued the carpentry tradition, and his son Balwinder Singh still practises the craft, using modern techniques. ""Ram Krishan lived quietly, serving as a witness to history's cruellest chapter and exemplifying resilience. His life was a reminder that even in times of hatred, acts of kindness could echo across generations,"" said his family.","Ram krishan singh was about 24-years-old during the division of india into two nations.

Bihar elections: Tensions in NDA? Jitan Ram Manjhi warns Chirag Paswan over past 'mistakes',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-elections-tensions-in-nda-jitan-ram-manjhi-warns-chirag-paswan-over-past-mistakes/articleshow/122232936.cms,"‘It’s Up To Them’ Owaisi Ready To Join Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Elections, Says NDA Must Go

NEW DELHI: Are the NDA allies growing wary of Chirag Paswan? Speculation is swirling after Union minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha chief Jitan Ram Manjhi warned that the Lok Janshakti Party leader would face consequences if he repeated his 2020 assembly poll strategy.Asked whether Chirag was trying to build pressure on the NDA over seat-sharing ahead of the year-end Bihar elections , Manjhi said, ""You saw what happened in 2020. He had to face the consequences of what he did. If he does the same again, the outcome will be similar. Bihar now has a double-engine government under Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar.""Praising the current NDA administration, Manjhi said progress had been made across sectors including roads, electricity, law and order, and governance.Chirag Paswan, however, chose not to escalate the matter and responded diplomatically: ""Jitan Ram Manjhi is like a father to me. Even if he says something harsh, I will accept it with respect. If the Opposition tries to project this as a rift in the alliance, they will fail.""The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) used the episode to take a swipe at the NDA. Party MP Manoj Jha said, “Sometimes they say one thing, sometimes another, and sometimes it’s all in gestures—but the intent is clear.This is their internal matter. The script of such differences is often written in the Delhi darbar.”In the 2020 assembly elections, Chirag Paswan’s LJP fielded candidates in 137 seats but won only one. However, by splitting the anti-BJP vote, particularly in JD(U) strongholds, the LJP is widely seen to have contributed to the JD(U)’s poor performance. The BJP ended up winning 74 seats, overtaking JD(U)'s 43, and emerged as the senior partner in Bihar for the first time.The assembly election is scheduled for the end of the year, where a high-stakes battle is expected. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) — consisting of the Janata Dal (United) led by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and the Bharatiya Janata Party — will face off against the Mahagathbandhan, which includes the Congress, RJD, and Left parties.","Chirag paswan's ljp fielded candidates in 137 seats but won only one.

Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi will make submissions before the court on Friday, appearing for Sonia Gandhi.The ED, through the ASG, submitted that Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were beneficial owners and in ultimate control of Young Indian, and that after the deaths of other shareholders they had 100% control.""These two persons controlled the All India Congress Committee.They saw that AICC released a Rs 90 crore loan to Associated Journals Limited, or AJL, a Rs 2,000 crore company, the publisher of National Herald newspaper.

He added that Sonia and Rahul Gandhi control Congress and wanted to get hold of Rs 2,000 crore instead of the said Rs 92 crore.As per the ED, Congress provided an interest-free loan of Rs 90 crore to AJL, which had assets worth Rs 2,000 crore, for a consideration of just Rs 50 lakh. This debt was allegedly converted into equity in YI's favour.""They deprived AJL's shareholders of their right. YI invested just Rs 50 lakh and got Rs 2,000 crore. YI gained wrongfully and shareholders suffered,"" he said.The court asked Raju if the shareholders are also witnesses in this case. Calling the matter a little peculiar, the judge asked whether they should not also be made witnesses. ""The ED has not investigated the 1,000 shareholders. So will this trial go on without them being witnesses,"" the court asked.The ASG replied, ""The record speaks for itself. This is a classic case of money laundering.

TOI on Sept 8 had first reported this crucial change in bidding parameters. ""The new provision of rating of bidders and assigning 30% marks for technical score will further bring quality players to bid for projects,"" said a senior official.The policy change gains importance considering that there has been major deterioration in preparation of project reports after consultancy firms bagged projects quoting very low and unsustainable prices. Poor project preparation impacts quality of work and results in delay in implementation.In developed countries such as Japan and Australia, govt entities pay more attention and time to preparation for DPRs for perfect execution.Officials admitted that there have been several cases where the prices quoted for preparing DPRs was as low as Rs 70,000-Rs 80,000 per km. ""At such a low cost, no one can prepare a good DPR. Field surveys cost more than such quoted price. That was the trigger for fixing the cost, which approximately comes to Rs 4-5 lakh for one km of 4-6 lane highway. This is barely 0.5% of the overall project cost. In most other countries the payment made for DPR preparation is around 10% of project cost,"" an official said.He added that provisions have been made where companies that have key personnel from top 50 reputed technical institutes, such as IITs and NITs, will get a better score.
