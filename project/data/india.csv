Ensure timely completion of works: Verma

NEW DELHI: Newly sworn-in Delhi ministers spent the day on Saturday doing a reality check on the ground by carrying surprise inspections and asking officials to fast-track projects that have been delayed or are stuck.PWD minister Parvesh Verma undertook an extensive review of projects in and around Mathura Road and Ring Road, zeroing in on the work on Barapullah flyover's extension, which has got inordinately delayed.""I was told that no minister had visited the project for a decade and no one even cared to get it completed even as the city is grappling with traffic jams,"" he said, adding that all this only made the city air more polluted.""If you delay a project, it also leads to cost escalation. The AAP govt didn't care about these things. I have asked for details of whatever clearances they need, and I will personally ensure that there are no further hindrances,"" he said. ""The road will be opened to the public in the next 12 months. Money is not an issue.""Explaining what plagues Delhi roads, Verma said these were repeatedly dug up by various agencies for laying underground cables or for other work. ""This is not the way to operate. We will have a nodal agency that will ensure all underground work is completed before a road is constructed so that the taxpayers' money is not wasted,"" Verma said. He emphasised the need for better coordination to prevent wastage of funds.Verma also reviewed the progress in construction of the Bhairon Marg underpass, part of the Pragati Maidan tunnel, and the Sarai Kale Khan stretch. He directed officials to ensure timely completion of all work. Emphasising the importance of quality construction, he said, ""We should build a road that lasts for 10-15 years. Though the official lifespan is five years, the quality should be such that it remains in good condition for at least 10-15 years.""He also inspected the Moolchand underpass, which has in the past witnessed severe waterlogging. To address this long-standing issue, he reviewed the upgradation of facilities with Japanese pumps being installed to make the drainage more effective.""I have directed officials to take all necessary measures before the rainy season to ensure that water does not accumulate. Proper drainage systems should be created and maintained, and pumps should be installed in time,"" he said.Verma said these efforts were in line with PM Modi's vision of a cleaner, greener and more developed Delhi. ""We are committed to transforming Delhi into a world-class city with better roads, effective drainage systems and overall beautification,"" he added.Education minister Ashish Sood visited Janakpuri and expressed his dismay over the accumulation of garbage. ""It has been lying scattered over a 1km stretch over the past two and a half years. This is unacceptable. People are hassled about AAP councillors. We are committed to cleaning this up,"" he said.Health minister Pankaj Kumar Singh visited Rao Tula Ram Memorial Hospital in Jaffarpur Kalan along with BJP MP Kamaljeet Sehrawat. ""The conditions here are quite bad. There is a lack of doctors. A building that should have been made before 2020 is incomplete. We have decided with Sehrawat that in 3 months, we will transform this hospital,"" he said. ""We will come back here after three months to show you how well this hospital is functioning.""On the mohalla clinics, he said: ""There are many clinics that do not have doctors or medicines. They were leased out by MLAs in the name of clinics. If these complaints are true, the matter will be investigated,"" he said.","Pwd minister parvesh verma undertook an extensive review of projects in and around mathura road and ring road.

and lockdown

Spl post created: Ex-guv of RBI Shaktikanta Das 2nd principal secy to PM

NEW DELHI: Former RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has been appointed as principal secretary-2 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , a post that has been created for the first time. The notification was made on Saturday by the appointments committee of the cabinet.The appointment of Das, a 1980 batch IAS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, would be co-terminus with the term of the PM. PK Mishra, a 1972 batch Gujarat cadre IAS officer, will continue as the current principal secretary to the PM.Mishra, who worked with Modi during his stint as Gujarat CM, was appointed to the post in Sept 2019 and was initially additional principal secretary. Former cabinet secretary PK Sinha also served as additional principal secretary for a short while. The PMO also had two advisers in Amit Khare and Tarun Kapoor, both retired secretaries.Shaktikanta Das, who was the 25th RBI governor, completed a six-year term in Dec after being given the job at a critical time. His predecessor Urjit Patel resigned abruptly after the relationship between the central bank and the govt soured over a raft of issues, including reducing rates to revive growth.A former economic affairs secretary, Das took on the task of repairing the relationship between the central bank and the finance ministry, and unleashed a number of measures which helped both monetary and fiscal policy to work seamlessly and ushered in stability in the delicate relationship.He improved the communication with the markets and helped open the central bank to the wider world with key officials interacting and communicating with all stakeholders, including the media.During his long innings as a civil servant, Das handled many challenges deftly, earning the trust of his bosses.Perhaps the toughest assignment for this soft-spoken bureaucrat was during the 2016 demonetisation drive. Das emerged as the face of the entire exercise and worked tirelessly with his team to ensure order and calm in the markets.He also worked to make sure that the impact of the disruption was minimised and the transition was smooth. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Das used his more than 40 years of experience as a civil servant to ensure that the markets functioned smoothly.Since the national lockdown was announced in late March 2020, a team of more than 200 personnel from RBI and services providers were holed up in four locations to ensure that the financial markets and the system across the country provided uninterrupted services.An alumnus of St Stephen's College in the capital with a master's degree in history, Das has held important positions in the central and state governments in finance, taxation, industries, infrastructure and other sectors.He was also member of the 15th Finance Commission and served as India's sherpa to G20 .","Former rbi governor shaktikanta das has been appointed as principal secretary-2 to prime minister narendra modi.

DGCA slaps notice on Air India after it sold broken seat to Chouhan

NEW DELHI: Union agriculture minister and ex-MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan found himself facing an uncomfortable journey Saturday when he was allotted a broken seat on an Air India flight from Bhopal to Delhi. His experience reignited concerns about Air India's service standards, while the airline attempts to improve its operations under Tata Group 's ownership.Expressing his frustration on X, he wrote: ""Today, (Feb 22) I had to come from Bhopal to Delhi... I had booked a ticket on Air India flight number AI 436. I was allotted seat number 8C. I went and sat on the seat, the seat was broken and sunken in. Sitting was uncomfortable."" Chouhan was allotted the seat despite the crew informing the management about the unserviceable seat & requesting it not be sold. ""Is this not cheating passengers?"" he asked.Shivraj Singh Chouhan was allotted a broken seat on an Air India flight. The aircraft in question was an Airbus A321 (VT-RTB), just a year old. This raises questions about Air India's maintenance of even its newest fleet.Chouhan further said: ""I had the belief that after coming under Tata management, Air India's service must have improved, but this turned out to be my illusion. After charging passengers the full amount, seating them on a bad and uncomfortable seat is unethical. Is this not cheating the passengers?""Co-passengers offered him their seats, he said. ""But why should I trouble another for my comfort? So, I decided to complete my journey in the same seat...,"" he posted.The incident prompted Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu to step in: ""We spoke to Air India and instructed them to take necessary action. From our side, DGCA will also be looking into details of matter promptly. And I have personally spoken to Shivraj ji also."" DGCA has now sought a report from Air India regarding the issue. This comes after a 2022 directive from the regulator that instructed the airline not to sell unserviceable seats, following complaints from business-class passengers who were downgraded to economy due to unusable seats.Air India responded to Chouhan's post, apologising for the inconvenience. Later, an airline spokesperson issued an official statement: ""This does not reflect the standard of service we strive to provide to our guests, and we are conducting a thorough investigation into the matter to ensure that such incidents are not repeated.""Supply chain constraints have delayed the repair of Air India's older aircraft, with the airline stating that its entire narrow-body fleet, like the one Chouhan flew on, is expected to be revamped this year. However, the overhaul of its aging wide-body Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft will take an additional two years.","Dgca slaps notice on air india after it sold broken seat to chouhan.

NEW DELHI: In the midst of its escalating political standoff with Tamil Nadu govt over National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre has made it clear that it is firmly committed to implementing the three-language policy at school level. Centre is steadfast in its stance and will not succumb to Tamil Nadu's ""blackmailing"" tactics, govt sources said.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a letter to Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Friday, criticised the state's opposition to NE, calling it ""highly inappropriate"" and a ""narrow-minded approach"". Pradhan sought to allay concerns raised by Tamil Nadu govt, saying, ""Let me unequivocally state that there is no question of imposing any language on any state or community.""NE advocates a flexible three-language formula, emphasising multilingual education, while allowing states to choose their own languages within the framework. However, Tamil Nadu govt has consistently opposed the policy, arguing that it undermines the state's long-standing two-language formula and poses a potential threat to linguistic identity.Despite the state's reservations, Union govt remains firm on implementing NE nationwide. Centre maintains that the policy is designed to enhance educational outcomes and foster multilingual proficiency without infringing upon regional linguistic preferences. Pradhan underscored this in his letter, stating, ""NE upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures that students continue to learn in the language of their choice.""""Apart from BJP-governed states there are multiple non-BJP states which are implementing this language policy. In fact, states like Assam and Odisha, among others, have been following a three-language formula till Class VIII which predates BJP govts there,"" said a senior govt official.The three-language policy, which has been a part of India's education framework since 1968, has been a major point of contention for long. Pradhan argued that its lack of proper implementation over the decades has led to a decline in the systematic teaching of Indian languages and an over-reliance on foreign languages. ""NE seeks to correct this historical oversight by ensuring that every Indian language, including Tamil, receives its rightful place in education while maintaining the flexibility for states to design their own language policies,"" he wrote.Pradhan cautioned that Tamil Nadu's continued opposition to NE could deprive its students, teachers, and educational institutions of the immense opportunities the policy offers.","Won’t give in to ‘blackmail’, centre makes it clear to tn.

HYDERABAD: Eight people were trapped inside when a portion of the tunnel roof at Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed on Saturday morning near Domalpenta in Telangana's Nagarku-nool district.Sources said 60 workers were on site when the roof suddenly caved in by about 200 metres inside the tunnel, which has a depth of 500 ft. While 52 of them managed to come out to safety, with some of them taken to hospital with injuries, eight workers remained trapped deep inside the tunnel.These included Jaiprakash Associates Limited project engineer Manoj Kumar and field engineer Sri Niwas, both from Uttar Pradesh, four labourers from Jharkhand - Sandeep Sahu, Jataks, Santosh Sahu and Anuj Sahu - and two machine operators of Robbins India Company - Sunny Singh from J&K and Gurpreet Singh from Punjab.According to sources, no communication had been established with the trapped people till reports last came in.

MANGALURU: In an alleged case of medical negligence, a doctor at a Mangaluru hospital left a surgical mop inside a woman's stomach during a C-section, putting her life in danger and requiring an emergency, life-saving surgery at another hospital two months later, after a CT scan exposed the doctor's carelessness. She is still not able to breastfeed her newborn.""We have undergone tremendous stress. We have posted the issue on National Consumer Grievance portal and Department of Consumer Affairs. We have spent lakhs of rupees on her treatment,"" the woman's husband said.Dakshina Kannada district health and family welfare officer Dr Thimmaiah H R said that a thorough probe would be conducted into the complaint.Recounting the ordeal, the husband posted on X that his wife underwent a C-section on Nov 27 at a private hospital, but a week after she was discharged on Dec 2, she developed a high fever and had to be readmitted to the hospital. Concerned about an unusual sensation on one side of her stomach, the couple insisted on an ultrasound scan, which revealed a 10 cm mass.However, the radiologist allegedly refused to disclose its details to the patient or communicate with the treating doctor in their presence. The doctor, in turn, dismissed their concerns, claiming it was a hematoma rather than a foreign object.As the discomfort persisted, the couple requested a CT scan for clarification, but the doctor reportedly disregarded the suggestion, insisting the condition would resolve over time. Although the woman's fever eventually subsided, follow-up ultrasounds showed no reduction in the mass. Meanwhile, she began experiencing severe joint, wrist, and leg pain, making it difficult for her to walk, stand, or even lift her baby to feed.A CT scan later confirmed the presence of a surgical mop inside her stomach. By then, the infection had spread to her lungs, blood, and other organs, putting her life at grave risk, her husband alleged. When the couple confronted the doctor who had performed the C-section, he allegedly refused to take responsibility.Ultimately, an emergency surgery was performed at another private hospital in Mangaluru's Puttur on Jan 25 to remove the mop. She was discharged on Feb 15, though she is still on medication.","A doctor at a mangaluru hospital left a surgical mop inside a woman's stomach during a c-section.

RANCHI/KOCHI: A Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) exam topper whose career got caught in a protracted legal tangle and a CBI probe into the fairness of the selection process was found dead with her IRS officer brother and their mother in a govt accommodation in Kerala's Kochi on Friday, six days after she failed to appear for a court hearing in Ranchi.Shalini Vijay , assistant director in the Jharkhand social welfare department, was on leave since 2020. She and her brother Manish Vijay, additional commissioner of central excise and customs in Kochi, are suspected to have entered into a suicide pact along with their mother Shakuntala.The matriarch's body was found covered in a white cloth with petals sprinkled all over, leading investigators to presume she died before the siblings purportedly took their lives in separate rooms of Manish's official quarters at Eechamukk in Kochi's Kakkanad neighbourhood.Investigators aren't ruling out the possibility of Shakuntala dying of any natural cause before her son and daughter hanged themselves.
