NEW DELHI: At least 18 people died, including 14 women and three children and over a dozen sustained injuries in a stampede that occurred on Saturday night at the New Delhi Railway station. The incident occurred after a massive surge in passengers heading to Maha Kumbh and those waiting for the trains that had got delayed.A two-member high-level committee has been formed to investigate the matter and determine the cause of the stampede, executive director of information & publicity at the Railway Board, Dilip Kumar said.This comes after the recent stampede at Maha Kumbh due to sudden surge in devotees on Mauni Amavasya that led to the death of 30.The authorities have said that the ""unprecedented"" rush of passengers at two platforms- 13 and 14- led to chaos and panic ultimately causing the stampede.In an official statement, the deputy commissioner of police (railway) reported that platform number 14 was already heavily crowded as the Prayagraj Express awaited departure. Additionally, delays in the Swatantra Senani Express and Bhubaneshwar Rajdhani Express led to an increased passenger presence on platforms 12, 13, and 14, further contributing to the congestion.""As per CMI, every hour 1,500 general tickets were sold by railways due to which the station got overcrowded and became uncontrollable. There was a stampede at platform no. 14 and near escalator near platform no. 16,"" the DCP said.DCP KPS Malhotra elaborated that the crowd surged within 15-20 minutes after the announcement of a special train, as passengers hurried to board. ""Two trains were delayed, and due to the increased footfall, the crowd grew massive. A few people sustained injuries. As of now, the situation is under control,"" he had said.An eyewitness recalled similar situation and said, ""The stampede broke out around 9.30pm... When people on platform number 13 saw trains on platforms 14 and 15 - they moved towards these platforms. The platforms of the trains were not changed, but the crowd was so huge that it could not be controlled....""One of the passengers, Dharmendra Singh, recounted his experience, stating that he was traveling to Prayagraj but faced difficulties as many trains were either delayed or canceled. ""I was going to Prayagraj but many trains were running late or were cancelled. The station was overcrowded. There were far more people than I have ever seen at this station. In front of me, six or seven women were taken away on stretchers.""Likewise, the railway ministry said, ""An Unprecedented rush situation developed today at about 10 pm in New Delhi railway station near platforms 13 & 14. Some of the passengers present there on the platforms fainted due to this sudden rush further leading to the rumours of stampede like situation. This led to the spread of panic.""The railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has ordered a high level inquiry into the incident.","At least 18 people died, including 14 women and three children and over a dozen sustained injuries in a stampede that occurred on saturday night at the new delhi railway station.

Deepa Sarai has history of radical connections

BAREILLY: There was nothing for over a decade. Mohammad Usman 's whereabouts had remained a mystery. A resident of Deepa Sarai in Sambhal, he vanished in 2012 without a trace - no calls, no letters, no clue about his fate. Then, on Saturday, the silence was shattered. Police suddenly received a letter from the home department confirming that Usman, now 46, was lodged in a jail in Lahore, Pakistan.The revelation left his family in shock and prompted intel agencies to investigate whether his disappearance was part of a larger, more sinister network - terrorism.With the Pakistani foreign ministry recently informing Indian authorities that he was arrested ""last year"", the mystery surrounding Usman has only deepened.Usman had told his family he was going to Delhi before he went missing. His brother, Mohs Farman, recalled a different timeline: ""In 1995, Usman had gone to Delhi, where he learnt AC repairing. He remained in touch with the family until 2012 but vanished after security agencies began searching for him as a suspected al-Qaida terrorist.""Where was he all this while then? Caught off guard by the revelation, Indian home ministry has now tasked Sambhal police with retracing his movements and determining how he ended up in Pakistan. There is also the need to fill up gaps in the chronology.Authorities suspect Usman may have been linked to a terrorist organisation, though no concrete evidence has emerged. His wife, Razia, and other family members have been questioned, but none could explain how he reached Pakistan, by which route and showing what papers. Meanwhile, police have stepped up surveillance in the entire district, scrutinising travel records and monitoring those who have visited Pakistan in recent years.Usman's case is not an isolated one. Deepa Sarai has a history of radical connections. The neighbourhood was home to Maulana Asim Umar, also known as Shannu or Sana-ul-Haq, who became the head of al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent before being killed in a US-Afghanistan operation in 2019. Umar disappeared in the 1990s, and intelligence reports indicate that 10 to 12 young men from Deepa Sarai have gone missing since - many later surfacing in Pakistan.Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi confirmed Usman's arrest to TOI, adding an unexpected detail.""During questioning in Pakistan, Usman mentioned that former Sambhal MP Shafiq-ur-Rahman Barq (grandfather of current Samajwadi Party MP Zia-Ur-Rahman Barq) lived in his neighbourhood and that he also knew a certain Haji Nazeeb well. However, he was unaware that Barq had passed away. We are still trying to find out who Nazeeb is""Police have intensified their investigation, gathering data on Usman's finances, communication records, and past movements. ""His family members have been questioned, and security agencies are probing all angles,"" Bishnoi said. ""We are collecting data on mobile numbers, bank accounts, and properties. Possible hawala transactions or high-value bank transfers are also being examined,"" he added.","Mohammad usman's whereabouts had remained a mystery.

Mucherla organ donation

success inspires villages in neighbourhood

HYDERABAD: At less than one per million population, India has one of the poorest organ donation rates in the world. But Mucherla in Telangana's Hanumakonda district is known for another kind of statistic - the 500 residents of this village have all pledged to donate their eyes after death.Over the past few years, around 70 villagers have donated their eyes.Mandala Ravinder, a divisional engineer in the irrigation department and a resident, told TOI he took the first step a decade ago by pledging to donate his mother's eyes. ""I strongly believe organs should not go waste after death. I pledged to donate my own organs and previously donated my father's organs in 2019. I encouraged others to follow suit, hoping it would help those in need and bring about positive change,"" he said.Inspired by Ravinder, many villagers followed suit, joining the movement to donate their organs and eyes. ""We inform Ravinder sir if a death occurs in the family. He, in turn, contacts the doctors, who do the needful. He is our go-to man,"" said Malla Reddy, a villager. Families actively participate in the cause, with many expressing how the decision has brought them closer, reinforcing the idea that even in death, one can continue to give, and live.The movement began several years ago when a few villagers took the first steps by pledging their eyes, and it quickly gained momentum. The success of Mucherla's organ donation initiative has sparked a ripple effect in neighbouring villages, with at least 20 individuals pledging to donate their eyes to the LV Prasad Eye Institute after their passing. Medical professionals regularly visit the village to conduct health camps and raise awareness about the importance of organ donation.Mucherla has also set up a well-organised system, keeping detailed records of those who have pledged to donate, and coordinating with hospitals in Hanumakonda district to ensure a prompt response when needed. ""We donated my mother's eyes, and I take immense pride in our contribution to reduce visual impairment in society,"" said B Sujatha, a villager. ""Our community's commitment has created a model of organ donation that continues to grow and inspire change. This achievement proves that when a community comes together with a shared purpose, we can make a meaningful difference,"" she told TOI.The village's dedication was recently acknowledged when it received the 'excellence in eye donation' award from the governor.","500 residents of mucherla in telangana's hanumakonda district have all pledged to donate their eyes after death.

Most deaths due to suffocation amidst chaos



NEW DELHI: A stampede at New Delhi railway station on Saturday night because of an unprecedented number of passengers headed for Maha Kumbh is learned to have claimed at least 15 lives, including three children. Many people were injured in the ensuing panic and mad scramble to either board the trains or rush out of the station.The chief casualty medical officer at LNJP confirmed that 15 people had lost their lives and 10 others were injured. The casualties we- re mostly due to suffocation. “Distressed by the stampede... My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones,” PM Modi posted on X.Thousands of passengers were caught in the deadly crush that unfolded in a matter of minutes, leaving a trail of death in its wake. Frantic screams and cries for help filled the air. The chaotic situa tion began to unfold at 9.45pm. A large number of people headed for Prayagraj had gathered on platform numbers 13 and 14 to board their trains, officials said. According to railway police, a massive crowd was waiting for Prayagraj Express on platform no. 14.“Swatantrata Senani Express and Bhubaneshwar Rajdhani were delayed, and passengers of these trains were also present at platform no. 12, 13 and 14, leading to a massive build-up of crowds,” a senior officer said. According to railway police, 1,500 general tickets had been sold and that was the primary reason the crowd became unmanageable.“The stampede-like situation was mainly on platform no. 14 and near the escalator near platform no. 1,” said a senior cop. The announcement of the arrival of a special train may have added to the chaos. An FIR of causing death due to negligence was being registered and a special team formed to investigate the matter.“Situation under control at New Delhi railway station.

I’m constantly monitoring operations,” the LG added.Initially, there were reports that four women had been hospitalised after they fainted due to suffocation. “The overcrowding resulted in severe suffocation, leaving four female passengers unconscious. Their condition was reported to be critical and they were immediately rushed to a hospital for medical treatment,” said DCP KPS Malhotra.Delhi Fire Services had received an emergency call and promptly dispatched four fir e tenders. Additionally, ambulances were rushed to the spot.A passenger going to Prayagraj said he was travelling with his family and had a reservation with the train scheduled to leave at 10.40pm. “We reached at 8.30pm but it was too crowded. Then the stampede happened. People fell in front of the train. Officials arrived and took away those who were injured. The situation was very bad between 7.30pm and 9.30pm.

These included 27 kg and 558 grams of gold jewellery, 1,116 kg of silver, and documents related to 1,526 acres of land, previously stored in the Karnataka Vidhana Soudha treasury. The transfer took place on Friday, following a Bengaluru court’s order for Karnataka to hand over the valuables.The process was overseen by court and government officials, who documented and photographed the items, revealing an opulent golden crown, an extensive jewellery collection, and a sword with intricate engravings. Petitioner Narasimha Murthy told PTI that only jewellery and documents were handed over, while 27 other items remained with Jayalalithaa's secretary since 1996.On Friday, the Supreme Court rejected a plea by Jayalalithaa’s legal heir seeking the return of the confiscated assets. A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma ruled that while the proceedings were abated after her death, it did not mean she was acquitted. The 2017 judgment in State of Karnataka v. J Jayalalithaa confirmed that the high court’s decision acquitting her had not attained finality.A special CBI court had earlier ordered the transfer of all confiscated assets to the Tamil Nadu government. The Karnataka High Court dismissed a plea by Jayalalithaa’s niece and nephew, J Deepa and J Deepak, who claimed the properties as her legal heirs. The court upheld the confiscation, stating the conviction of her co-accused remained valid.The seized properties include Veda Nilayam, her Chennai residence, land parcels, estates, bank deposits, and valuables amassed between July 1991 and April 1996.","The tamil nadu government has officially taken possession of assets seized from late chief minister j jayalalithaa.

The Telangana chief minister had claimed that PM Modi did not belong to the backward classes at the time he was born, which the BJP criticised calling it an ""irresponsible"" comment.Union minister G Kishan Reddy hit out at Reddy for the comments, saying the CM ""should make statements based on facts"".""How can he (Revanth Reddy) speak so irresponsibly? If you make a statement, it should be based on facts,"" said Kishan Reddy, who is also the president of Telangana BJP told news agency PTI.Revanth Reddy, speaking at a Congress event on Friday, also accused PM Modi of being ""anti-backward class in mentality."" The CM claimed Modi's caste was classified as a ""forward caste"" before he became Gujarat Chief Minister.Retorting to the CM's claim, G Kishan Reddy asserted that the BJP has taken several measures for the welfare of backward classes. He said the BC Commission was granted constitutional status after Modi became Prime Minister, not during previous Congress regimes.The CM was speaking after a presentation on the government's caste survey and SC categorisation exercise in the state.Revanth said the BJP was trying to portray the Congress government's caste survey in Telangana as faulty as otherwise the Modi govt would be under pressure to conduct it in the entire country and also amend the Constitution to enhance BC reservations.He also asked how the BRS and BJP could say the survey statistics were wrong when there was no official statistic available before the Congress' survey.""We did the survey scientifically and 96.9 per cent of population in Telangana gave details voluntarily. The survey forms were filled up or signed by the family member who gave details. Now, we have started a second round of survey to give an opportunity to the remaining 3.1 per cent,"" Revanth said.""It doesn't matter even if I end up as the last chief minister from the Reddy community. As a disciplined party worker and CM, I took up the caste survey to keep the promise given by our leader Rahul Gandhi. This is my commitment. The caste census was not done for my benefit or my position. The caste survey is accurate and there are no faults in its statistics. I am ready to remain an activist to uphold the ideals of our leader Rahul Gandhi. If the BCs fall prey to opposition campaigns, they will lose forever,"" the CM said.Reacting strongly, BJP leader N Ramchander Rao also condemned Reddy's remarks terming them as ""cheap"" and in poor political taste.Rao said that the statement was made to divert the people's attention from the caste census ""fiasco"" of the Congress government in the state.""The remarks by the chief minister of Telangana about the caste of Prime Minister Narendra Modi are cheap and in poor political taste. This statement has been made by the Congress party only to divert their caste census fiasco, which has failed in the state,"" Rao told ANI.""Their ministers themselves said that the entire census needs to be reviewed since some people have been left out,"" he added.BJP OBC Morcha national president K Laxman also lashed out at Telangana chief minister, saying that his statement about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's caste was ""false.""""The statement made by CM Revanth Reddy on PM Narendra Modi's caste is completely false... Before becoming the CM of Gujarat, PM Narendra Modi's caste was added to the OBC list of the Gujarat government in 1994 and to the Centre's list before 2000...

Smugglers use TikTok to target Indians for illegal US migration: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smugglers-use-tiktok-to-target-indians-for-illegal-us-migration-report/articleshow/118280916.cms,"New York Post

As a second US plane carrying deported Indian nationals prepares to land in Amritsar, a report has revealed that smugglers are openly using social media to facilitate illegal migration to the United States. According to the, human traffickers , known as ""coyotes,"" have been advertising their services on TikTok, offering Indian nationals a route into the US via Canada for as much as $5,000. These posts, claim to provide a ""100% safe"" journey with ""payment after reach.""The social media posts promise a hassle-free crossing from cities like Montreal, Brampton, and Surrey into the US states of New York or Washington. The New York Post contacted a smuggler who confirmed a charge of $4,500 for a journey involving a two-hour car ride and a 25-minute walk through the woods, where migrants are given a map to navigate the border. Up to five individuals are reportedly taken at a time in these ""group walks.""While smugglers continue to exploit social media for illegal migration, the US has intensified its crackdown. On Saturday, a plane carrying 119 deported Indian nationals is set to arrive at Amritsar’s Sri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport. This marks the second batch of deportees under the Trump administration’s stricter immigration policies. Official told confirmed that 67 of those being deported are from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, three from Uttar Pradesh, two each from Goa, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. A third flight, carrying 157 deportees, is expected to arrive on February 16.Earlier this month, a US military aircraft transported 104 deportees back to India. Many of them had attempted to enter the US using “donkey routes,” a term for the illegal and often dangerous paths taken by migrants. These individuals had reportedly paid large sums to human traffickers but were caught at the border and sent back in shackles.The deportations have sparked controversy, particularly in Punjab, where chief minister Bhagwant Mann has accused the central government of deliberately choosing Amritsar as the landing site to ""defame Punjab and Punjabis."" Addressing the media on Friday, Mann questioned the selection of Amritsar over other major airports like Delhi, alleging a political agenda behind the move. He claimed that the Centre was portraying Punjab as a hub for illegal migration, despite the issue being a nationwide problem.“The BJP-led Centre always discriminates against Punjab. It does not let go of any chance to defame the state,” Mann said. He insisted that Punjab would welcome the deportees with dignity and offer them support, including a visit to the Golden Temple’s langar. Mann also demanded action against fraudulent agents responsible for misleading youth into illegal migration.In response, BJP leader Tarun Chugh accused Mann of playing politics over the issue. He argued that the real concern should be why so many young people were forced to migrate illegally in the first place. “People of Punjab want to know who misled these youths, who forced them to sell their land and homes. Rather than catching the culprits, the AAP leader is politicising the issue,” Chugh said.","Human traffickers are advertising their services on tiktok, offering indian nationals a route into the us via canada for as much as $5,000.

Additionally, another Congress MP Manish Tewari came out in support of Punjab CM.""He is absolutely right. The first aircraft that landed with immigrants who were brought back in inhuman conditions had most of the people from Gujarat. That flight should have landed in Gujarat, but it landed in Amritsar to create an impression that all illegal immigrants are from Punjab and that it is the only state with economic distress... If you are not able to crack down on agents, it is a failure of the government..,"" Priyanka Chaturvedi said.""What Bhagwat Mann said was merely to create headlines. It was all meaningless. The flight should have been landed in Delhi... Punjab is not getting defamed in any way. Punjab has a lot of NRIs, and they contribute to our economy in a big way. Punjabis are living a happy life abroad... What are the governments doing to stop such large-scale emigration?"" asked Congress's Gurjit Singh AujlaHe further questioned the state government over the actions taken to create employment in the state. ""What has the state government done to employ our people, and what is the state's law and order?... Because the people of Punjab are economically well-off, they prefer to go to the US. Indians have emigrated in large numbers to Europe and UAE as well... This shows the condition of our country. The BJP and AAP government should look into it...,"" he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Manish Tewari reiterated Mann's views and said that the central government was ""trying to send a message that every illegal immigrant to the USA is from Punjab.""""...Why are these planes landing in Punjab? What is the kind of message you're trying to send? Are you trying to send a message that every illegal immigrant to the USA is from Punjab Punjab CM is absolutely correct to that extent. There were people from Gujarat and Haryana. You could have landed this plane in Delhi or anywhere else. Why in Amritsar all the time?...Delhi does not understand that Punjab does not take very easily to humiliation and there is always a cost to pay when Delhi tries to humiliate Punjab,"" he said.The political over the choice of state erupted on Friday after there were reports of two other fights from the US with illegal Indian deportees set to land in Amritsar over the weekend. There is no official confirmation of this so far.Reacting to these reports Punjab CM and AAP leader Bhagwant Mann had questioned the foreign policy and asked if a Bangladeshi national Sheikh Hasina could be made to land at Hindon, Ghaziabad, then why not Indian nationals.""The MEA should tell the criteria based on which Amritsar was selected to land the aircraft. You select Amritsar to defame Punjab. America's military planes are landing in Amritsar, and an enemy country, Pakistan, is right next to it. Lahore is 40 km from there... What kind of foreign policy is this?"" he had questioned.""Sheikh Hasina landed in Hindon. Ghaziabad. Why can these (Indian citizens who allegedly illegally migrated to the US) be landed in Hindon? Amritsar is being chosen deliberately to portray that only Punjabis are illegal migrants... Why is Ahmedabad or Ambala not chosen?... BJP always conspires to defame Punjab... They don't let international flights operate from Amritsar, claiming that it is not suitable for it, so why are flights coming in from the US now?... I will strictly oppose this... I demand to the MEA and the MHA that the plane is still onboard, change the route and make it land in Delhi, Hindon or Ahmedabad...,"" he added.BJP leaders dismissed the claims saying that this wasn't the first time that illegal immigrants have been deported. ""This is not the first time illegal immigrants have been deported. Even EAM mentioned that it has happened many times before... Now that it has been highlighted, it has created news. All those migrating illegally need to worry... Why doesn't Bhagwant Mann tell everyone that most of the deportees are Punjabis?

""Can Bhagwant Mann, who also holds the home portfolio, let Punjabis know how many travel agents were booked under the same law in the last three years,"" he asked.Mann, meanwhile, promised that the state govt would first investigate why the deportees had gone abroad, which agents deceived them, and how much money they had lost, so that efforts could be made to recover the money.

He reiterated that Centre was determined to transform the holy city - home to the Golden Temple, Durgiana Temple, Ram Teerath, and Jallianwala Bagh, along with its rich textile heritage - into a ""deporation centre"".Expressing sympathy for Indians being deported from the US, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee offered to provide them transportation from the airport to their homes.
