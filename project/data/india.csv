Rainmakers at work: Decoding the hope and hype of cloud seeding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rainmakers-at-work-decoding-the-hope-and-hype-of-cloud-seeding/articleshow/125211967.cms,".

In Hindu mythology, mortals prayed and performed elaborate rituals to please Indra, the god of rain. Legend has it that musician Tansen's melodious voice could summon showers from cloudless skies. Ordinary mortals, however, have neither the Ashvamedha yagna nor Tansen's tenor. In modern India, a new kind of rainmaker relies on science, not song to coax moisture from the sky. While Dilliwalas' hopes of a downpour may have dried up after this week's failed experiment, this handful of rainmakers remain convinced that the science of cloud seeding works - when used the right way.Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification that involves dispersing particles like silver iodide or calcium chloride into moisture-bearing clouds to stimulate rainfall. Research has shown that it can enhance rain by 18-46% and help prevent drought, water scarcity and related problems. It has been used with varying degrees of success across the world, particularly in China and the US. In India, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, has conducted cloud seeding experiments and research since the 1970s, but it was only in 2003 that states began on-ground experiments in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for rain enhancement.This is the first time cloud seeding has been used to tackle pollution.Bengaluru-based Agni Aero Sports Adventure Academy has worked with Maharashtra, Andhra and Rajasthan for rain enhancement since 2003. Its founder Arvind Sharma, a trained microlight aviator, says the Delhi experiment may have done more harm than good. ""Cloud seeding cannot create rain. It can enhance rain under specific weather conditions including cloud formation and moisture. It is no surprise that the project has failed,"" he says.Helmed by Sharma, the company has run projects in rain-shadow areas of Andhra and Maharashtra that come with their own set of challenges. ""Pilots are trained to stay away from turbulence to protect passengers and the craft. In cloud seeding, we not only go seeking turbulence but also go right into the clouds,"" Sharma says, explaining how the plane needs to be at close range to inject the clouds with the chemical.Prakash Koliwad, founder of Kyathi Climate, which has run projects with IITM Pune and worked on several missions in Maharashtra and Karnataka between 2015 and 2019, says there has been 30 years of research in the field, establishing it as sound science. He argues that if used well, it is not as exorbitant as it is being made out to be. ""The Maharashtra govt spends Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in drought relief every year and must combat problems like farmer distress and suicide. If they spend 0.1-0.2% of that amount at the beginning of the monsoon season to enhance rainfall, they will no longer have to face angry farmers or distress,"" he says.So why has this technique not become more popular? Suman Akkaraju, CEO of Siri Aviations, attributes it to lack of awareness. ""Cloud seeding is still viewed as an experimental approach by many. Awareness, regulatory clearances, and public understanding take time. But with more proven outcomes and better data, adoption is slowly increasing.""The Delhi govt is reported to have spent Rs 65 lakh a day, while projects that run for several months can cost Rs 30-40 crore. A more cost-effective method was recently deployed by Rajasthan, billed as India's first drone-based cloud seeding. However, that too, has a patchy track record. In Aug-Sept this year, the govt used drones to create artificial rain to revive Ramgarh lake with no success.Though a bit of a damp (or dry) squib in India, the technology has found favour abroad. The first pioneering attempt was documented by Vincent Schaefer in 1946, who used dry ice to increase snowfall. The US has used cloud seeding in mountainous areas since the 1950s to increase snowfall and even deployed it in Operation Popeye, a secret five-year US military programme during the Vietnam War, meant to lengthen the monsoon season and disrupt enemy movement. Cloud seeding was also used at the 1980 Moscow and 2008 Beijing Olympics, though it wasn't to make it rain but to prevent it. It was reportedly used even at the 2012 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. China and UAE have invested heavily to tackle drought.Back home, environmental experts have dismissed the cloud seeding exercise as ""theatrics"" that fail to address the root causes of air pollution. Gufran Beig, of the National Institute of Advanced Studies and founder-director of SAFAR, says cloud seeding is a highly specialised scientific project that must be executed with care. ""Even in the most favourable conditions, the probability of success is 50-60%, which is before and post-monsoon season. The probability at this time of year goes down to 10%,"" he says.","Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification.

JNU Clash: Student Union President Among 28 Detained, 6 Cops Injured During Protest Against ABVP





NEW DELHI: In a decisive victory, the Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday, with Aditi Mishra of AISA becoming the university's first woman president since Aishe Ghosh in 2019. The results mark a strong comeback for the Left, which had lost one post to ABVP in the delayed 2024-25 polls this April.Mishra, a PhD student from Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory, secured 1,937 votes, defeating ABVP's Vikas Patel, who polled 1,488 votes. The margin of 449 votes is up from 272 recorded in the April poll.The presidential candidate of Progressive Students' Association (PSA), Shinde Vijayalaxmi Vyankat Rao, who gained traction among voters with her fiery presidential speech targeting both left and right politics on the campus, took away 1,276 votes while NSUI trailed with 419 votes.In the vice-presidential race, Left's K Gopika Babu from SFI registered the highest tally across all posts, winning by a massive margin of 1,314, up from 34 in the April poll. She secured 3,101 votes while ABVP's Tanya Kumari got 1,787 and NSUI's Shaikh Shahnawaz Alam 370.For the post of general secretary, Left's Sunil Yadav from DSF won by 104 votes, a little dip from April's 114, polling 2,005 votes against ABVP's Rajeshwar Kant Dubey's 1,901.The joint secretary's post was also clinched by Left, with Danish Ali securing 2,083 votes and defeating ABVP's Anuj Damra (1,797) by a margin of 286 votes. In the previous poll, ABVP had bagged this post with a margin of 45.This year's election saw 20 candidates in the fray for the four central panel posts, including six woman candidates, reflecting an increase in women's participation in the campus politics.During the early rounds of counting, when about 4,300 votes were tallied, ABVP was leading on two seats — general secretary and joint secretary. However, once votes from School of Social Sciences and School of Languages were opened, Left secured the lead on all posts. Both these centres have historically voted overwhelmingly for Left candidates.The day-long counting unfolded amid high-decibel sloganeering, drum beats and bursts of celebration as each round was declared. Late at night, tensions briefly flared when a group of students carrying Palestine flags clashed with ABVP supporters. Students alleged that ABVP members tore a flag while ABVP denied the charge, claiming the group had raised anti-govt slogans.Observers say the results reaffirm the united Left's dominance on the campus. The outcome also signals that while new entrants like PSA have injected energy into the campus discourse, the traditional Left remains the primary force shaping student politics at JNU, they add.","Left sweeps jnusu polls, first woman prez since 2019.

Chennai: At least 136 MBBS seats in the state, including 22 in govt medical colleges and nine seats in AIIMS-Madurai, were vacant after three rounds of counselling by Centre's medical counselling committee, as students who were allotted seats did not join the respective institutions. The committee has said that 802 MBBS seats across India are vacant.""These seats are in the seat matrix for the stray round. They are likely to be filled as the penalty for not joining the seats allotted in the stray round is higher,"" said a senior official of the counselling committee.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

Also read:

The city woke up to a chilly Saturday covered in a blanket of smog on Saturday as the air quality deteriorated to 'very poor' levels, with several areas slipping into the 'severe' category and many others on the verge. It was also Delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11C, three notches below normal. The capital's overall AQI stood at 337 at 9am, rising to 343 by noon. By 4pm, it settled at 361 - among the worst readings this season - and was 380 by 8pm. So far this season, the worst average AQI the city recorded was 371 on October 31.Residents grappled with burning eyes, sore throats, and itchy noses amid a thick, choking haze. By late afternoon, more areas had entered the severe category, including Nehru Nagar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Bawana and Burari. The air quality is very likely to stay in the very poor category till November 11.However, Delhi Pollution Control Committee said the city's air quality this Nov has, so far, remained better than the corresponding period last year. Officials said that for six out of seven days, the AQI was lower than last year's readings, adding that unlike last year, when emergency restrictions under Grap 3 were invoked on Nov 13, this year the govt has initiated mitigation steps much earlier.Grap 3 is yet to be implemented this year as CAQM officials state it will only kick in once the AQI turns 400 or worse.Residents have been urged to avoid burning biomass, waste, or wood, especially as temperatures fall and such practices become common for heating. Large housing societies have been advised to replace coal or wood-fired heaters for security guards with electric ones. Construction sites have been asked to ensure anti-smog guns are installed and operational, particularly at projects above five floors, till at least Nov 29. DPCC also said that staggered office timings should continue. CM Rekha Gupta announced that the govt will soon extend Ujjwala benefits to slums, enabling them to switch to clean cooking fuel. The govt has also instructed departments to step up road cleaning, dust suppression and pavement repair.Itchy eyes, sore throat, choked lungs: Air quality takes a toll on residents | page 4Noida: Smog continued to choke Noida on Saturday, with several neighbourhoods waking up to a burning sensation in the eyes, sore throats, and increasing breathing discomfort. As the Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in 'very poor' category, residents said they have stopped early-morning walks, jogging, cycling, and other outdoor activities because of the thick layer of haze that blankets the skyline.CPCB data showed Noida's overall AQI rose to 354, up from 306 a day earlier.""It's impossible to step out for walks anymore. Even five minutes outdoors leaves the eyes and throat burning,"" said Pramila Dhar of Sector 78. ""Parks across high-rise clusters that are usually crowded on weekend mornings remained near-empty today.""Ghaziabad fared no better, with air quality sliding further to 339 from Friday's 314, while Greater Noida slipped from 'poor' to 'very poor', reaching 336 compared to 284.Station-level readings presented a grim picture for Noida. Sector 116 - which covers the 7x sectors - recorded the highest AQI at 357, followed by Sector 125 at 347, Sector 62 at 345, and Sector 1 at 341, all in the very poor range.Nisha Rai, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Noida's Sector 77, said people in the area have been facing respiratory problems. ""People in the area are suffering from sore throats and breathing difficulties. We don't see water sprinkling being done, and the sky remains grey. We have also stopped outdoor activities,"" she said.Shreya Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Pratishtha in Sector 75, said the AOA has started sprinkling water on its own. ""There is rampant construction in the neighbourhood, and trucks and dumpers carrying materials create dust. However, there is no official check on such activities. We have advised children to stay indoors during morning and evening hours when pollution levels are high,"" she said.In Greater Noida, Knowledge Park V recorded an AQI of 322 and Knowledge Park III 328, both in the same category.Manish Kumar, a resident of Supertech Eco Village 1, said most roads in the area are covered in dust. ""There is no mechanical sweeping in Greater Noida West, and construction materials are transported and stored uncovered. We submitted a letter to the environment minister on Friday, seeking his intervention,"" he said.In Ghaziabad, Vasundhara was at 388 and Loni 364, in the very poor category, while Sanjay Nagar and Indirapuram were in the poor range at 298 and 278.Meanwhile, Delhi's overall AQI stood at 361 - among the worst readings this season. By 10pm, the hourly AQI was 385 and 20 out of the 36 monitoring stations have turned severe. However, the stricter restrictive measures under Graded Response Action Plan stage-III are yet to be implemented, and only preventive and advisory measures continue under GRAP-II. Officials at Commission for Air Quality Management, however, said stage-III would kick in only after AQI turned 400 or worse.Meanwhile, the city recorded the lowest minimum temperature for Nov on Saturday at 11 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal against Friday's 12.7 degrees.","Saturday was delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11c, three notches below normal.

From Sidhu Moose Wala To Canada: Lawrence Bishnoi Gang Expands Threat To Global Punjabi Scene

'Bringing two gangsters back to India a challenge'

NEW DELHI: Indian security agencies have achieved a big breakthrough in their operations against criminals, with the detention of two of most-wanted gangsters -Venkatesh Garg and Bhanu Rana - operating from foreign soil.The detentions were made in Georgia and the US, marking a major success in the effort to dismantle international criminal networks.The first criminal, Venkatesh Garg, was apprehended in Tbilisi. Garg, associated with the gang led by UK-based Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu, is wanted in more than 10 criminal cases, including the high-profile murder of a BSP neta in Gurgaon. Garg, a resident of Haryana's Narayangarh, was living in Georgia and recruiting youth from Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and other states for carrying out contract killings.Garg's chief Sangwan belongs to Najafgarh in southwest Delhi and is known for running an organised crime syndicate from London, coordinating extortion, murder and arms-related offences. A team of cops from Delhi and Haryana is learnt to have reached Georgia to expedite Garg's extradition. Cops anticipate that Garg will be brought back to India at the earliest to face trial in over a dozen criminal cases registered against him in Haryana and Punjab.The second detention is that of Bhanu Rana, who was taken into custody in the US. Rana is linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Bishnoi, who hails from Punjab and began his criminal career during student politics, now runs a vast network of hundreds of associates across India and abroad who are involved including heinous crimes, including murder and extortion.The Lawrence Bishnoi gang has been implicated in numerous violent crimes, including murder and extortion, and has recently gained notoriety for operating its syndicate from behind bars.Police investigations have revealed that Bhanu Rana's criminal network is deeply entrenched across Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. His name had also previously surfaced during the investigation into a grenade attack in Punjab.Intelligence suggests that some of Rana's associates based in the US are actively connected to Bishnoi's criminal operations. Indian agencies are now working to secure Rana's swift deportation from the US. Multiple accomplices of Rana have already been arrested in India, and he faces numerous chargesheets in several criminal cases.Sources said these detentions abroad exposed a wider network, as over two dozen Indian gangsters are believed to be operating from abroad, running extortion and smuggling rackets by hiring operatives from India.""The detention of both Garg and Rana is a blow to their respective gangs and underscores the commitment of Indian law enforcement to pursue high-value targets across international borders,"" a senior officer said.Sources, however, pointed out that bringing the gangster duo back will be a challenge given the complex extradition procedure, which requires them to submit a range of documents to probe charges prima facie and establish their wanted status.",Venkatesh garg & bhanu rana are two of india's most-wanted gangsters.

says

GRAP-III

not needed as of now

NEW DELHI: The capital's air quality continued to deteriorate for the fourth day running, with the city's average AQI inching closer to 'severe' levels on Sunday. The day's average air quality index was recorded at 370, in the upper range of 'very poor', the second worst of the season so far after October 30, when the index was at 373.Delhi woke up to another morning of toxic smog but, just as on the previous day, winds picked up towards late afternoon, providing some relief. The average AQI at 8 am Sunday was 391, close to the 'severe' range that starts from 401. By 11 am, the air remained just as bad, with the AQI at 389. The day's official 24-hour average is taken at 4 pm, when the air had improved a bit.The share of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana on Delhi's PM2.5 levels continues to be low, with the figure dipping to nearly 5% from 8% on Saturday.""The wind speed reached 14-15 kmph in the afternoon. While yesterday the wind was northwesterly, coming from Punjab and Haryana, today it changed to westerly and south-westerly. Thus, the fire farm impact,"" said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet.According to the Centre's Decision Support System (DSS), the share of farm fires was 5.3% on Sunday. The share has been less than 10% so far this season while in the past years it has peaked at over 40%.The DSS did not issue any forecast on the impact of stubble burning for Monday. The air quality early warning system expects the air quality to remain within the very poor category.""The air quality is very likely to be in the very poor category from November 10 to 12,"" it stated. The AQI is expected to stay 'very poor' for the subsequent six days as well, the note added.Meanwhile, the Commissioner for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) said that they are not imposing strict pollution preventive measures under Grap-III.The CAQM issued a statement asserting that in the wake of Delhi's daily average AQI hovering around the higher end of the very poor category in the morning, a review meeting was held on GRAP.""However, the sub-committee, while reviewing the current air quality scenario of Delhi-NCR and forecasts for weather/meteorological conditions made available by IMD/IITM, noted that at 10am the hourly average AQI of Delhi was 391... Given that Delhi's daily average AQI has since shown a consistent declining trend, with AQI improving to 370 at 4 pm and further improving to 365 at 5 pm today, with the dynamic model and forecasts for weather/meteorological conditions and AQI by IMD/IITM also indicating the overall AQI of Delhi to stay in the 'very poor' category in the coming days, the sub-committee opined that invocation of stage-III of GRAP is not required at the moment,"" CAQM stated.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa pointed to a slew of measure being taken by the city govt, including installing sprinklers, fixing pollution norms for industries etc, while attacking the previous AAP govt, stating that while they let Delhi's pollution worsen for 10 years and expect it to be cleaned in 7 months.""The inaction of pollution of 10 years cannot be fixed in 7 months... AAP commented on the location of the Bawana monitoring station, which was installed by them. They spent money on advertisements and not on fixing pollution. We are working to make the situation better,"" said Sirsa.Delhi, meanwhile, continued to feel the chill, recording a minimum temperature of 11.6 degress Celsius on Sunday, which was three degrees below normal. This was marginally higher than Saturday's season low of 11 degress Celsius. The maximum was 28.1 degrees Celsius, which was a degree above normal. IMD has forecast shallow fog on Monday morning, with both maximum and minimum temperatures expected to stay in a similar range.","The day's average air quality index was recorded at 370, in the upper range of'very poor' the share of pollutants from farm fires in punjab and haryana on delhi's pm2.5 levels continues to be low.

BHOPAL: What began as a wildlife meat seizure of blackbuck and sambar in Madhya Pradesh has exploded into one of India's most chilling wildlife crime investigations - a sprawling probe that has unearthed an alleged trophy-hunting syndicate operating across nine districts, linked to affluent clients, rifle-club insiders and even cross-border hunting circles.Nearly a year after three Mumbai-based youths were arrested, forensic specialists have cracked encrypted mobile data from seized phones, uncovering a cache of videos, GPS logs and chat records that laid bare a covert commercial game-hunting racket posing as ""sports gatherings"". A total of 60 kills of blackbuck, chinkara and sambar have been established between 2022 and 2024. The operation, investigators say, turned protected forests into private killing grounds for the wealthy.Moreover, the case has now drawn the attention of the Bishnoi community of Rajasthan, which holds blackbucks sacred. The community has filed an intervening application (IA) before MP high court's Indore bench, opposing the bail plea of one of the suspects, Salman Piyarji of Mumbai. The IA will come up for a special hearing on Tuesday.This massive antelope poaching was reportedly modelled on southern Africa-style game hunts, where wealthy participants pay to track and shoot animals for trophies or meat.Investigators said those involved had studied and replicated safari-hunting formats - complete with preselected ""targets"", night chases, and trophy photo sessions in the forests of central India.Among the decrypted files is a video purportedly showing a blackbuck being shot, then its throat being slit with a knife to drain its blood as it gasps for air. Recorded under torchlight, the footage is one of several videos showing alleged night hunts carried out by the syndicate. There are many more.Sharad Jatav, spokesperson for State Tiger Strike Force (STSF), told TOI that the forensic data has ""opened a Pandora's box"". ""They mainly targeted males, be it blackbuck, chinkara, chital or sambar. We have matched the videos with the mobile-location data of the suspects,"" Jatav said.He said males were targeted because their horns were taken as trophies. ""Whether these outsiders were being charged by the Bhopal-based group facilitating these hunts or if it was purely for sport is still under investigation. Key local suspects are yet to be arrested. Their questioning will reveal more. The rifles have been sent for a ballistic examination,"" he said.Jatav said the group first met during a religious gathering in Bhopal, and ""it is possible that more game hunters from other states travelled to Madhya Pradesh for similar expeditions"".Investigations also revealed that two members of the alleged syndicate had travelled to southern African countries to practise hunting legally for trophies and meat from antelopes.The decrypted data indicates that between 2022 and December 2024, the network orchestrated hunts that killed more than 60 protected animals across Narmadapuram, Rajgarh, Sehore, Shajapur, Raisen, Vidisha, and parts of Bhopal, Ujjain, and Indore divisions. These alleged hunts were marketed to clients as exclusive ""wildlife sport experiences"".The case first came to light in Dec 2024, when STSF, Indore forest department, and local police arrested three alleged poachers - Johar Sain, Iyaz, and Salman Piyarji - at Kishanganj forest range in Indore district. Officers seized 65kg of suspected wildlife meat, a country-made pistol, three live cartridges, and an SUV with a Maharashtra registration allegedly used for transporting carcasses. After months of forensic analysis, the fourth arrest was made on Oct 24 this year when Sabah (45), son of Salasin, was picked up from Mitra Nagar, Jogeri, Mumbai.Investigators are examining possible links between the alleged hunters and certain rifle club members suspected of supplying weapons, ammunition, and logistical support. Some are believed to have helped identify forest-edge hunting zones for the group. ""The evidence confirms a commercial operation masquerading as sport. More arrests are expected in Maharashtra and Rajasthan,"" a senior investigator said.","A total of 60 kills of blackbuck, chinkara and sambar have been established.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

NEW DELHI: NDA and Mahagathbandhan face the challenge of retaining their bastions and making fresh headways in the last phase of Bihar polls, and much will depend on whether their smaller allies, which will be fighting a majority of their seats on November 11, can deliver after having driven a good bargain from their principal partners.For NDA, Union minister Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV) is contesting 15 of its total 28 seats - the nomination of one of its candidates was rejected - and Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM (Secular) all six of its constituencies in the second phase of elections.While both Paswan and Manjhi are Dalit mascots of the governing alliance, its Kushwaha face Upendra Kushwaha, too, has a lot at stake as his candidates, including his wife Snehlata Kushwaha, are in the fray in four of the six seats his party, RLM, was allotted.If BJP-JDU alliance has to change its fortunes in Magadh region, where RJD-led MGB had won 20 of 26 seats in 2020, its two key Dalit constituents have to make it count on the 11 constituencies they are contesting in its five districts.A share of 29 seats for Chirag had triggered some heartburn within NDA, and he has often harped on his 100% strike rate in Lok Sabha elections to raise his bargaining power within the alliance.For MGB, Congress is contesting 37 of its 61 seats and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) seven of its 12 seats, of the total 122 constituencies going to the polls on Tuesday.The opposition alliance is banking on Mukesh Sahani-led VIP to swing the Nishad votes, who account for 2.6% of the total population, according to the state's caste survey.Sahani was a part of NDA in 2020, and MGB has walked the extra mile to keep the 'son of Mallah' in good humour, agreeing to his demand for naming him as its deputy chief ministerial choice if elected to power.The Tirhut region has been a traditional stronghold of NDA, and MGB is hoping to push the ruling alliance back there. NDA currently holds 23 of the 30 seats that go to the polls on Tuesday and eight of the 10 in Madhubani district, a part of Mithilanchal region, another bastion of the ruling alliance.Among the various forces at work in these polls, in no region have they drawn more attention than Seemanchal, which has the highest concentration of Muslims in Bihar. Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM is again in the fray there, having stumped MGB in 2020 with victories in five of 24 seats in its four districts.Congress is fighting on 12 seats in this region, as against RJD's nine. NDA had won 12 seats in Seemanchal in 2020, and alliance members believe that if AIMIM manages to draw a section of Muslim votes, then they can do well on the back of Hindu consolidation. However, the calculation guiding MGB is that Muslims will solidly back it this time, and it can significantly boost its numbers by also cornering a section of Hindu votes.Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor, too, has run an energised campaign to create a third pole in the state's binodal politics, and a record turnout of over 65% in the first phase of polls on November 6 has made him as well as the two main alliances claim popular support. Which means that a similarly high turnout on Tuesday will only further the puzzlement over who actually is gaining from the enthusiasm of the electorate.JDU was the lead NDA player in the first phase of polling as it contested 57 seats, as against BJP's 48.In the second phase, BJP will contest 53 compared to JDU's 44. For MGB, RJD is contesting 71 seats and CPI(ML) six in this phase amid ""friendly fights"" among its constituents on several seats.",Nda and mahagathbandhan face the challenge of retaining their bastions and making fresh headways in the last phase of bihar polls.

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj chief Prashant Kishor on Sunday dismissed the ""notion"" that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi holds any meaningful sway over Gen Z voters in Bihar.He further criticised Gandhi's limited engagement and understanding of the state.In an exclusive interview with news agency ANI, Kishor said, “How much knowledge does Rahul Gandhi have here? Rahul Gandhi comes here, roams around, does a couple of show bites and then he is gone.”He questioned the idea that Bihar’s youth would rally behind Gandhi’s calls on issues like “vote theft” or protecting democracy.“When the people of Bihar are not listening to him (Rahul Gandhi), then why would Gen Z listen to him? Gen Z is not a homogeneous group in Bihar who acts on someone’s call or on the basis of their assessment,” he said.Referring to recent protests in Nepal that led to the fall of the former PM KP Sharma Oli's government, Kishor said some people were “getting excited” after the Gen Z movement there but stressed that Bihar’s political landscape is different.“Bihar is a very political place. It is not like Bangalore. People won’t have clothes, food, jobs, but there is a lot of political optimism among the people here. And the result of this is that people are leaving their work and doing politics day and night.But I don’t think there is going to be a revolution by someone’s call here,” he said.Kishor underlined that youth play an important role in Bihar’s politics, primarily because of unemployment and migration.“The youth between 20 and 30 years, who are facing a bit of unemployment. Not a bit, I mean he is facing a lot of difficulties due to unemployment. They are forced to go out, enduring the tough life there. That is definitely a big factor in Bihar. You can call him Gen Z, you can call him a youth, you can call him a millennial. This is the terminology,” he said.Commenting on the Congress party’s role in the upcoming elections, Jan Suraaj founder said it remains marginal.“I had also said at that time that Congress is a follower of RJD in Bihar. They are a big party of the country. They are the leaders of the opposition in the country. They belong to the Gandhi family. So it is natural that the media will cover them,” he said.“But from the point of view of Bihar, there is no presence of Congress. Congress is not a factor. There is no discussion of Congress. What is Congress doing? Congress has little effect. Politically, you can see it in Seemanchal. In Seemanchal, I think that even today, the Muslims are more tilted towards Congress than RJD,” he added.Hours before the first phase of polling, Gandhi had appealed to young voters, particularly Gen Z to come forward and “save democracy through truth and non-violence.”In a video message posted on X, Congress leader addressed “Gen Z brothers and sisters” from Bihar, urging them to turn out in large numbers and vote responsibly.“My young friends from Bihar, my Gen-Z brothers and sisters — tomorrow is not just a day for voting, but a day to decide the direction of Bihar’s future,” he said.Referring to his repeated “vote theft” allegations, Gandhi added, “You’ve seen how in Haryana, a nefarious game of vote theft was played. In Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh — everywhere, these people have tried to suppress the people’s voice. Now their eyes are on Bihar, on your votes, on your future.”He urged voters to “stay vigilant against every conspiracy” and to “walk the path of truth and non-violence” while supporting Mahagathbandhan candidates in their constituencies.The first phase of the Bihar assembly elections concluded peacefully on Thursday with a record voter turnout, while the remaining 122 constituencies will vote in the second phase on November 11.

"India, China look to restart cultural, people exchanges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-look-to-restart-cultural-people-exchanges/articleshow/125211664.cms,".

How it works

NEW DELHI: With the resumption of direct flights between India and China, both countries are looking to resume the high-level mechanism for cultural and people-to-people exchanges early next year.The mechanism chaired by the foreign ministers has met twice so far - in 2018 and 2019 - and its resumption is key to advancing cooperation in a range of areas like tourism, culture, media and academic exchanges.The next, or third, meeting is expected to take place in Delhi. The decision to restart direct air services saw China Eastern launching on Sunday its first Shanghai-Delhi flight, which witnessed 95% occupancy.Since they resolved the military standoff in eastern Ladakh, India and China have taken a series of steps to normalise the relationship.In Hindu mythology, mortals prayed and performed elaborate rituals to please Indra, the god of rain. Legend has it that musician Tansen's melodious voice could summon showers from cloudless skies. Ordinary mortals, however, have neither the Ashvamedha yagna nor Tansen's tenor.In modern India, a new kind of rainmaker relies on science, not song to coax moisture from the sky. While Dilliwalas' hopes of a downpour may have dried up after this week's failed experiment, this handful of rainmakers remain convinced that the science of cloud seeding works - when used the right way.Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification that involves dispersing particles like silver iodide or calcium chloride into moisture-bearing clouds to stimulate rainfall. Research has shown that it can enhance rain by 18-46% and help prevent drought, water scarcity and related problems. It has been used with varying degrees of success across the world, particularly in China and the US. In India, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, has conducted cloud seeding experiments and research since the 1970s, but it was only in 2003 that states began on-ground experiments in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for rain enhancement. This is the first time cloud seeding has been used to tackle pollution.Bengaluru-based Agni Aero Sports Adventure Academy has worked with Maharashtra, Andhra and Rajasthan for rain enhancement since 2003. Its founder Arvind Sharma, a trained microlight aviator, says the Delhi experiment may have done more harm than good. ""Cloud seeding cannot create rain. It can enhance rain under specific weather conditions including cloud formation and moisture. It is no surprise that the project has failed,"" he says.Helmed by Sharma, the company has run projects in rain-shadow areas of Andhra and Maharashtra that come with their own set of challenges. ""Pilots are trained to stay away from turbulence to protect passengers and the craft. In cloud seeding, we not only go seeking turbulence but also go right into the clouds,"" Sharma says, explaining how the plane needs to be at close range to inject the clouds with the chemical.Prakash Koliwad, founder of Kyathi Climate, which has run projects with IITM Pune and worked on several missions in Maharashtra and Karnataka between 2015 and 2019, says there has been 30 years of research in the field, establishing it as sound science. He argues that if used well, it is not as exorbitant as it is being made out to be. ""The Maharashtra govt spends Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in drought relief every year and must combat problems like farmer distress and suicide. If they spend 0.1-0.2% of that amount at the beginning of the monsoon season to enhance rainfall, they will no longer have to face angry farmers or distress,"" he says.So why has this technique not become more popular? Suman Akkaraju, CEO of Siri Aviations, attributes it to lack of awareness. ""Cloud seeding is still viewed as an experimental approach by many. Awareness, regulatory clearances, and public understanding take time. But with more proven outcomes and better data, adoption is slowly increasing.""The Delhi govt is reported to have spent Rs 65 lakh a day, while projects that run for several months can cost Rs 30-40 crore. A more cost-effective method was recently deployed by Rajasthan, billed as India's first drone-based cloud seeding. However, that too, has a patchy track record. In Aug-Sept this year, the govt used drones to create artificial rain to revive Ramgarh lake with no success.Though a bit of a damp (or dry) squib in India, the technology has found favour abroad. The first pioneering attempt was documented by Vincent Schaefer in 1946, who used dry ice to increase snowfall. The US has used cloud seeding in mountainous areas since the 1950s to increase snowfall and even deployed it in Operation Popeye, a secret five-year US military programme during the Vietnam War, meant to lengthen the monsoon season and disrupt enemy movement. Cloud seeding was also used at the 1980 Moscow and 2008 Beijing Olympics, though it wasn't to make it rain but to prevent it. It was reportedly used even at the 2012 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. China and UAE have invested heavily to tackle drought.Back home, environmental experts have dismissed the cloud seeding exercise as ""theatrics"" that fail to address the root causes of air pollution. Gufran Beig, of the National Institute of Advanced Studies and founder-director of SAFAR, says cloud seeding is a highly specialised scientific project that must be executed with care. ""Even in the most favourable conditions, the probability of success is 50-60%, which is before and post-monsoon season. The probability at this time of year goes down to 10%,"" he says.","Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

NEW DELHI: As air quality in the national capital continues to plunge, several Delhi residents gathered at India Gate on Sunday demanding that the government take concrete policy measures to curb the city’s persistent air pollution crisis. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Priyanka Kakkar also joined the protest, accusing the government of being in “denial” about the problem.Protesters called for urgent action to address the hazardous air, which has pushed the air quality index (AQI) close to 600 in some parts of Delhi - a level classified as “severe.” Participants said their demonstration was peaceful and aimed at drawing attention to what they described as government inaction on the worsening situation.Speaking to reporters at the protest, Kakkar accused the BJP-led Delhi government of manipulating the data and demanding them to be on ground with the public.“People of Delhi are angry because the government of the national capital is in denial. They are not accepting that there is pollution. Rekha Gupta is sitting in her office-home after ordering 13 air purifiers - she should have been here. This is public anger. Because the BJP government didn’t take even a single step to address pollution and everyone knows it this time.The BJP government should have been with the people on the ground and not manipulating the data” she said.One protester said, “We want policies from the government to take action on the worsening situation of air quality. The AQI is touching heights, it’s around 600. In European countries everyone has the right to protest - here when we are protesting peacefully, no one wants to listen. We are being evacuated and not allowed to protest peacefully here. This is very wrong, we are not hurting anyone.”The resident further added, “All we’re saying is no matter whose government it is, common people are dying. Yet the government is not designing any policies and hiding the data. They are sprinkling water at the data centres. No one is working, the entire work force is in Bihar. What about our lives? Have we taken birth here to die?”Also read: What are you smoking? Delhi wakes up to thick smog as air quality sinks to ‘very poor' Expressing frustration over failed experiments like cloud seeding, the protester said, “It’s been 11 years since they have been in government but they haven't done anything to bring about change. Even the cloud seeding didn't work. That is, anyway, not a solution. We want a permanent solution.”The demonstrator also lamented the lack of public participation in such protests, saying, “Even the public is fast asleep. Many people are here to watch the show, but they are not raising their voices in protests. We demand from the government to take action on the issue and make policies.”The protest comes amid alarming levels of pollution across Delhi-NCR, as authorities grapple with deteriorating air quality ahead of winter.","Several delhi residents gathered at india gate on sunday demanding that the government take concrete policy measures to curb the city’s persistent air pollution crisis.

"Many still sitting on old note stashes, hoping for exchange",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gang-cheats-traders-sitting-on-old-notes/articleshow/125195600.cms,".

GHAZIABAD: Nine years after demonetisation, crores of invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes remain stashed with people, sustaining a grey market large enough for organised fraud. This was evident from the arrest of eight members of a gang over the last two weeks.The men were allegedly behind a multi-level racket that trapped clients, mainly traders and middlemen still hoarding invalid notes, via social media sites by promising discreet conversion of demonetised currency in exchange for hefty commissions.Investigation revealed that no currency was ever exchanged, and the gang simply collected bundles of demonetised currency and their advance fees before vanishing. Police have so far recovered demonetised notes worth Rs 3.9 crore from their stash.""Most victims never approached police because their own transaction was illegal,"" Trans-Hindon DCP Nimish Patil said. ""The fraud operated through a structured, three-tier chain. The first tier, which included the recently arrested SK alias Sharik and Abhinav alias Rahul Buddhi Raja, handled negotiations with victims and offered assurances of converting the notes at 25% of face value.The second comprised collectors who sourced demonetised currency directly from clients, and the third consisted of couriers who transported the notes to designated handover points. ""Police said the gang used WhatsApp, Telegram and encrypted calling apps to connect with potential clients. Conversations were coded, identities were masked, and SIM cards were changed frequently to avoid tracking. Abhinav, identified as the mastermind, coordinated activities across the chain and handled communications between collectors and couriers.In two rounds of arrests-first on Oct 31 and then on Nov 6 night-cops also nabbed Fakhruddin, Nasruddin, Shubham Chaudhary, Arun Kashyap, Mahesh Prasad and Jitendra Kumar.An FIR has been registered under BNS sections 318(2) (cheating), 62 (punishment for attempting to commit offences), 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) and 3/5 (common intention) and 5/7 of the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017.Police are now examining the digital trails and financial links between the accused and their clients. Investigators say two to three other suspects named in the FIR are yet to be traced. For now, officers are expanding their focus to traders and middlemen who approached the gang, the very people who kept this underground market alive.""Victims rarely report these cases because they fear legal consequences. That secrecy is what the gang exploited for years,"" the DCP said.","Gang used whatsapp, telegram and encrypted calling apps to connect with potential clients. Conversations were coded, identities were masked, and sim cards were changed frequently to avoid tracking. Police have so far recovered demonetised notes worth rs 3.9 crore from their stash.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125195601,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-804509,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Drone near house: Aaditya; it's for a survey: Civic body,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drone-near-house-aaditya-its-for-a-survey-civic-body/articleshow/125211832.cms,"Aaditya Thackeray

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray Sunday complained about a drone ""peeping"" into Matoshree, the heavily guarded residence he shares with party chief Uddhav Thackeray and his mother at Bandra's Kalanagar, raising concerns about potential surveillance. MMRDA and police clarified that the drone was part of a survey being conducted for the proposed pod taxi service in the area, but Aaditya asked why residents weren't informed beforehand.""A drone was caught peeping into our residence [on Sunday] morning and when the media learnt about it, MMRDA said it was a survey being done for BKC with police permission,"" Aaditya said on X. ""What survey allows you to peep inside homes and fly out quickly when spotted? Why weren't residents informed? Is MMRDA only doing surveillance of our house?"" He said MMRDA ""should rather get on the ground and focus on its own work, like the MTHL (Atal Setu), which is an example of its corruption. ""In response, MMRDA said the drone survey was conducted over the weekend along the approved pod taxi alignment-from Kurla to Bandra via BKC-to facilitate a visual study of the corridor. ""All necessary permissions were obtained by MMRDA on behalf of the concessionaire from the police department, and every instruction issued by them was strictly adhered to,"" it said on X.It said the certified drone operator, whose background verification was already submitted to the authorities, carried out the survey in the presence of police personnel and concessionaire officials.""The operation remained fully compliant and restricted to the approved alignment, with no breach or deviation at any stage."" DCP (zone 8) Manish Kalwaniya confirmed that all permissions were in place.Sena (UBT) MLC Anil Parab, however, demanded a detailed police inquiry. ""[The drone] raises serious concerns about a potential security breach in a high-security zone,"" he said.Uddhav recently visited Marathwada region and interacted with farmers affected by heavy rain and floods over the last few months. He has targeted CM Devendra Fadnavis over the relief package announced by the state govt and stressed the opposition's demand for Rs 50,000 per hectare compensation for crop losses and a complete farm loan waiver.The pod taxi project, being implemented on a public-private partnership basis, aims to enhance last-mile connectivity to the business hub of BKC through electric-powered vehicles on an 8 km elevated corridor.",Aaditya thackeray raises concerns about potential surveillance.

Lawyer jumps from house to evade cops, breaks legs

AGRA: A 40-year-old lawyer allegedly raped a gang-rape survivor in an Agra hotel room after luring her with the promise of arranging an out-of-court settlement in a 2022 sexual assault case in which he was reportedly representing one of the accused, reports Sudeep Lavania.The 24-year-old had travelled from Auraiya to attend a hearing Thursday when Jitendra Singh alias Jitendra Dhakre took her to a hotel, served her alcohol during the car ride, and assaulted her. Police arrested him two days later after he jumped from a neighbour's rooftop during a raid and fractured his legs while trying to flee.The rape survivor had come to Agra to appear in court in connection with the gang-rape case against three men in Etmadpur. Advocate Jitendra Singh, who, she said, approached her the same day, claimed he could mediate a settlement with the other accused. He later booked a room for her at a city hotel, saying it was too late for her to return home.The woman told police that Singh initially left her in the hotel room but returned later that night with dinner and, under the pretext of discussing the case, allegedly raped her. She added that though he locked the door from inside and prevented her from leaving, she managed to slip out under the pretext of getting water and hid inside the hotel until he left.She approached police the following morning and filed a complaint, based on which an FIR was registered under BNS section 64(1) (rape).Investigators visited the hotel, collected CCTV footage and visitor records, and launched a manhunt to trace Singh. A forensic team examined the room, and officials said both digital and physical evidence were being preserved. Police also recovered entries from the hotel's visitor register and CCTV footage showing Singh and the woman entering the premises together.Agra DCP (city) Sayeed Ali Abbar said, ""During a raid at the accused's house, he jumped from a neighbour's roof and fractured both legs. He was admitted to SN Medical College. We secured his remand Saturday and produced him before the court. He has been sent to judicial custody. The woman was sent for a medical examination.""","Jitendra singh, 40, allegedly raped a gang-rape survivor in an agra hotel room.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has finally granted permission for Phool Walon ki Sair following the intervention of lieutenant governor VK Saxena, Raj Niwas officials said on Sunday. Last week, the organising body, Anjuman Sair-e-Gul Faroshan, announced that it had decided to cancel the event as DDA did not give permission for the annual festival in Mehrauli's Aam Bagh.The approval has been conveyed to the organisers, an official said. Following reports about the cancellation, Saxena had ordered an investigation. It revealed that the permission was delayed due to a forest and environment department direction on Nov 28, 2023, that prohibits the organisation of such a festival in the area, the official claimed.For a week every year, the centuries-old festival transforms Mehrauli with floral offerings at the dargah of Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki and the Yogmaya temple. Kites fly, qawwalis are sung and wrestling matches are held. Each day, a particular activity takes place. DDA permitted the festival regularly till 2023 and had even facilitated its organisation in 2024, the official said.However, the organisers this time insisted on a written permission, which was issued after LG's intervention.The permission has been given on the condition that no harm will be caused to the environment during the festival, said officials.The organisers said the event would be held in Feb-March next year. ""We have not yet received any written or verbal communication from DDA regarding therequired permission,"" said Usha Kumar, general secretary of Phool Walon KiSair, Anjuman Sair-e-Gul Faroshan. Another organiser noted that while the department earlier gave verbal assurances, there wasn't enough time left for the extensive preparations. LG has urged action against the erring officials. ""He has reiterated that any official found acting in deterrence to public interest will be punished,"" an official said.","The permission was delayed due to a forest and environment department direction on nov 28, 2023, that prohibits the organisation of such a festival in the area.
