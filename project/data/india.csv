NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday issued a warning to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu, both key members of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA alliance at the Centre.Referencing the collapse of the Shiv Sena government—a move his party has long accused the BJP of orchestrating—Thackeray cautioned that what happened to his party could also happen to them in the future. He warned that the BJP’s ongoing campaign to weaken regional parties poses a serious threat to their political futures.He also raised concerns about alleged electoral malpractice, including voter fraud and electronic voting machine (EVM) manipulation. Ahead of meeting former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Thackeray said, ""The future of our country is in doubt. We do not know where our vote is going amid voter fraud and EVM fraud. Are elections in India still free and fair? What happened to us, Kejriwal ji, and Congress could happen to Nitish ji, RJD, and Chandrababu ji Naidu in the future.""He accused the BJP of systematically targeting regional parties, saying, ""BJP's dream is to break up and finish off every regional party, just as they are doing with democracy in this country.""Following his meeting with Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi, Thackeray reiterated the importance of opposition unity in addressing electoral issues. ""Governments come and go, but our relationship will remain. The people of Delhi know the work Kejriwal has done over the last decade. The Election Commission played a major role in the Delhi elections. The INDIA Bloc and all opposition parties must strategise on the next steps, as elections in our democracy are no longer free and fair,"" he said.Thackeray's comments come amid growing concerns within the opposition over alleged irregularities in the electoral process. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi recently highlighted discrepancies in Maharashtra's voter registration figures, claiming that 39 lakh new voters were added in just five months after the Lok Sabha elections. He also alleged that Maharashtra's registered voter count exceeded the state's total adult population.On Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray's statement, JDU MP Sanjay Kumar Jha says, ""He has no knowledge of ground reality. The backward, Dalit, and poor communities of Bihar started voting only after the EVM was introduced. Before that, when voting used to happen using ballot paper, people used to steal the booths... He (Aaditya Thackeray) does not need to worry about JDU and Nitish Kumar...""In response to Aaditya Thackeray’s statement, JDU MP Sanjay Kumar Jha has criticised Thackeray’s understanding of the situation in Bihar. Jha stated, ""He has no knowledge of the ground reality. The backward, Dalit, and poor communities of Bihar only began voting after the introduction of the EVM. Prior to that, when ballots were used, booth capturing was rampant.""Jha further asserted that Thackeray should not be concerned about the JDU or Nitish Kumar.","Shiv sena leader aaditya thackeray warns bihar cm nitish kumar and andhra pradesh cm n chandrababu naidu that what happened to his party could also happen to them in the future.

Lessons for opposition ahead of key elections

Bengal's Political landscape: A different story?

Nobel laureate Amartya Sen has underscored the ""strong need"" for unity between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), stating that the two parties should have contested the Delhi elections together with mutually agreed commitments. Speaking to PTI from his ancestral home in West Bengal's Birbhum district, Sen warned that if secularism in India were to survive, political parties must not only unite but also uphold the values that have made the country a model of pluralism.""I don't think the result of the Delhi elections should be exaggerated, but it certainly has its significance. And if the AAP had won there, that victory would have carried its own weight,"" Sen said.Delving into the reasons behind AAP’s electoral loss, the eminent economist pointed to a ""lack of unity among those who did not want a Hindutva-oriented government in Delhi."" He emphasized that in several constituencies, the BJP’s margin over AAP was smaller than the number of votes Congress received, indicating that a united front could have changed the outcome.According to Sen, another crucial factor was AAP’s unclear stance on secularism.""What were the AAP’s commitments? I don’t think the AAP succeeded in making clear that it was firmly secular and for all Indians. There was too much catering to Hindutva. So it's not even clear how committed it was against religious communalism,"" he asserted.However, he acknowledged AAP’s work in education and healthcare, suggesting that Congress should have aligned with the party on these issues.""My daughter lives in Delhi, and she and her family praise AAP’s efforts in school education and healthcare. The Congress could have come together with AAP, saying, 'We like their schools, we like their hospitals, and we want to expand them further.' That would have been a better approach,"" he suggested.Sen also criticized opposition parties for failing to focus on public services, which, he argued, allowed their opponents to steer the narrative towards issues like liquor licenses and tax laws.""The AAP could have focused more on secularism, healthcare, and education while also working towards an alliance with Congress. Instead, they stood on opposite sides,"" he remarked.Looking ahead, Sen believes the Delhi elections offer lessons for upcoming contests, particularly in Uttar Pradesh.""The lesson to learn from the AAP’s poll debacle is to reinforce what the Samajwadi Party did in the general elections: take a clear stand against Hindutva politics. Most Indians don’t want a Hindu Rashtra,"" he emphasized.When asked whether Delhi’s results might influence next year’s Bengal Assembly elections, Sen acknowledged that all elections in India have ripple effects. However, he expressed confidence in Bengal’s political culture.""In Bengal, even though secular parties like the Trinamool Congress, the CPI(M), and the Congress have gone separate ways, there remains a social consensus on secularism, education, and healthcare. I do not see a Delhi-type debacle happening here,"" he predicted.Sen believes that with greater focus on honest governance, justice, and tolerance, Bengal is unlikely to fall into the ""sectarian trap."" He envisions an India that prioritizes education, healthcare, and unity.""I would like to see an India where everyone has access to education and reliable healthcare, with a vision of unity not just for the nation but for the world. These aren’t just dreams—they’re achievable goals if we follow good, cooperative politics,"" he concluded.","Nobel laureate amartya sen has underscored the ""strong need"" for unity between the congress and the aam aadmi party.

The move triggered a heated exchange in the House, with the BJP and Opposition members locking horns over the issue.Later, union home minster Amit Shah in the Lok Sabha said that BJP has no objection on addition of any dissenting notes.Earlier in the day, Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge led the charge, accusing the government of sidelining opposing views in an attempt to push the report through.""In the JPC report on the Waqf Board, many members have their dissent report... It is not right to remove those notes and bulldoze our views... This is anti-democracy ... I condemn any report that has been presented after deleting the dissent reports.

There is no deletion or removal from the report. Everything is on the floor of the House. On what basis can such an issue be raised? The members of the Opposition are creating an unnecessary issue, which is not a fact. The allegation is false. The JPC conducted entire proceedings as per the rules...

Dhankhar said, appealing to Kharge to rein in the Opposition members.

Rajat's lover's family files plaint, accuses him of poisoning her

MUZAFFARNAGAR/ROORKEE: It was a cold December night in 2022 when Rajat Kumar and Nishu spotted a crumpled Mercedes - upside down, smouldering - near Roorkee on Delhi-Dehradun highway. They didn't know then that the man they pulled from the wreckage, half-conscious and bleeding, was cricketer Rishabh Pant . They called the police and stayed on till help arrived. Pant later said they were ""heroes who helped me... I'll be forever grateful and indebted"".Months after Pant gifted him a scooter as a token of gratitude, Rajat is fighting for his life in a hospital, accused of a crime he insists he didn't commit. On Sunday, Rajat, 25, and his girlfriend Manu Kashyap (21), consumed poison together. Their love was not meant to last - different castes, disapproving families, marriages arranged elsewhere.In despair, Rajat and his lover made a suicide pact , or so it seemed. A resident of their village, Buchha Basti, spotted them writhing on the ground and raised the alarm. By the time their families arrived, much damage was done. They were rushed to a local hospital. Manu's family transferred her to another facility, where she died before dawn on Tuesday, while Rajat, barely clinging to life, is still in treatment.Then, hours after Manu was cremated, her mother walked into Purkazi police station and filed a murder complaint against Rajat, accusing him of poisoning her daughter.Now, the village that once took pride in Rajat's bravery whispers about scandal. In a place where ""family honour"" is currency, a young man and woman trying to defy caste and family expectations is not just a personal crisis - it is a communal one.Muzaffarnagar SP Satyanarayan Prajapat said no police case had been filed until Manu's mother intervened. The local police have turned their attention to Manu's mother's allegations. ""We have received a written complaint from the woman's family, accusing Rajat of poisoning her,"" Singh told TOI.Doctors said Rajat is showing signs of recovery. ""Both consumed a strong pesticide,"" said Dr Dinesh Tripathi of Pragya Hospital. ""We began immediate treatment. Manu's family moved her elsewhere, but Rajat is improving under our care.""","Rajat kumar and manu kashyap consumed poison together.

Spouse entitled to alimony even in void marriages: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spouse-entitled-to-alimony-even-in-void-marriages-supreme-court/articleshow/118190734.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday ruled that a spouse involved in a void marriage like bigamy is also entitled to seek permanent alimony and maintenance from his or her partner under the Hindu Marriage Act .In view of contradictory judgments delivered on the issue of maintenance of spouse in cases of void marriage, a three-judge bench of Justices Abhay S Oka, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Augustine George Masih passed the judgment and held that void marriages also come under the ambit of Sections 24 and 25 of Hindu Marriage Act which talks about maintenance and alimony.The marriages are void under 1995 Act: (1) If one or both the parties to the marriage have a spouse living at the time of marriage; (2) The parties to the marriage are within the degrees of prohibited relationship; and (3) The parties are sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two. A sapinda relationship is based on a common ancestor within three generations on the mother's side and five generations on the father's side.""A spouse whose marriage has been declared void under Section 11 of 1955 Act is entitled to seek permanent alimony or maintenance from the other spouse by invoking Section 25 of the Act. Whether such a relief of permanent alimony can be granted or not always depends on facts of each case and the conduct of the parties. The grant of relief under Section 25 is always discretionary,"" SC said. It held that maintenance could also be granted during litigation.SC passed the order on a plea filed by a man, who submitted that there may be cases where a wife may be responsible for concealing her first marriage and induce the husband to marry. But the bench said the entitlement under Section 25 does not depend on whether the bigamous marriage is moral or immoral.SC took exception to Bombay HC full bench order for using objectionable terms for women involved in void marriage. ""...the full bench has coined the term illegitimate wife. Calling the wife of a marriage declared as void as an illegitimate wife is very inappropriate. It affects the dignity of the concerned woman.""","Supreme court rules that a spouse involved in a void marriage like bigamy is also entitled to seek permanent alimony and maintenance from his or her partner under the hindu marriage act.

Out-of-syllabus questions

erode

NTA credibility

further

NEW DELHI: A record 12 JEE-Main questions were dropped from the final answer key due to errors, the highest in recent history, raising serious concerns about the National Testing Agency 's ability to conduct a fair and transparent exam of such a large scale.Despite reducing the total number of questions from 90 to 75, the error rate surged to 1.6%, far exceeding historical 0.6% threshold. Adding to the concern is NTA's lack of transparency, with inconsistencies in its claims about the number of dropped questions, raising suspicions of ""under-reporting"" NTA DG P S Kharola did not respond to TOI questions. Education ministry has forwarded a reply from NTA that ignored syllabus discrepancy concerns, deepening scepticism about its accountability.An examination of past answer keys contradicts NTA's claims, revealing multiple instances of error-free papers in previous years. Before 2025, the highest number of dropped questions was six in Session 1 of 2024 and four in Session 2.NTA claimed that six questions were dropped in Session 1 of 2023, 2024 and 2025, but the official answer key for 2025 lists 12 dropped questions. TOI's analysis found five questions were dropped in Session 1 of 2023, while 2022's Session 1 and 2 had four and six dropped questions, respectively. No questions were dropped in the Feb and March 2021 exams. Despite this, the agency defended itself, stating, ""This year's record-low challenge rate and minimal errors reaffirm NTA's commitment to ensuring a fair, transparent, and error-free examination process for engineering aspirants nationwide.""Experts highlight that inconsistencies in language translations further erode trust in the exam process. At least two translation errors were found in the final answer key, causing confusion. Incorrect answers were later marked correct, creating additional discrepancies. Students answering in Hindi and Gujarati had two answer choices, while others had only one, raising concerns about fairness. The inclusion of out-of-syllabus questions further damaged confidence in NTA's reliability.Educators and students have expressed frustration, stating, ""In a prestigious exam like JEE, where students' futures are at stake, such incompetence is unacceptable."" Errors led to confusion, such as a logic gate question from the 22nd Shift 2 paper being dropped after being deemed invalid. Physics questions also contained errors, while translation inconsistencies and marking mistakes persisted.Despite assurances of a well-structured exam, students encountered multiple out-of-syllabus topics.""For example, the Carnot Cycle, removed from the syllabus years ago, appeared unexpectedly in the paper. Likewise, Newton's Law of Cooling, omitted for the past two years, suddenly had 22 related questions. This misalignment between the syllabus and the actual exam content further added to students' distress,"" an educator lamented, adding, ""we expected a better paper this year - one without errors and irrelevant questions. Instead, we got a complete mess.""Students lost valuable time on incorrectly framed questions, with some spending 10-15 minutes struggling with ambiguous problems, affecting performance and rankings. As one student put it, ""It's not just about dropping incorrect questions - it's about the time students wasted on them. That's a huge injustice.""NTA has faced criticism for mismanaging various exams, including last year's NEET-UG and UGC-NET, which were marred by controversies over paper leak allegations and irregularities. Given past failures, expectations were high for improvements in JEE-Main 2025 . However, despite recommendations from the Radhakrishnan Committee categorising JEE-Main as a high-stakes exam, the agency appears to have repeated its mistakes. The committee stated, "" ...It is to be ensured that questions created will have uncontested answers... ""Amid these inconsistencies, JEE-Main faces serious credibility issues due to NTA's continued mismanagement and lack of accountability.","A record 12 jee-main questions were dropped from the final answer key due to errors.

Can't interpret law in this manner to protect crooks, ED argues in SC

NEW DELHI: Observing that Enforcement Directorate 's attitude should not be to keep an accused in custody, Supreme Court Wednesday granted bail to former bureaucrat Arun Kumar Tripathi despite stiff opposition from the agency, which said ""crooks"" who were damaging the country should not be protected.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan expressed disapproval over ED opposing the bail when the order of the trial court taking cognisance of the offence of money laundering had already been quashed by the high court. It said PMLA was being misused like dowry harassment provisions of IPC Section 498A . ED had arrested Tripathi, an Indian Telecommunications Service officer, on Aug 8, 2024 in a money laundering case connected with the Chhattisgarh liquor scam .Strongly opposing the bail on behalf of ED, additional solicitor general S V Raju said, ""Crooks cannot get away on technical grounds. This is a serious case. Senior bureaucrats are fleecing the country. They are milking the economy and taking money to Dubai and Netherlands. HC did not pass the order on the ground that there was no offence but on a technical ground. Interpretation of law should not be done in such a way to protect crooks.""The bench, however, did not agree. ""The concept of PMLA cannot be to ensure that a person should remain in jail. I tell you frankly, looking at several cases... See what happened in 498A cases, if this is the approach of ED, it is very, very serious,"" the bench told Raju.As the court further raised questions on ED's approach of not taking sanction from the authority concerned despite knowing that it was required, Raju said it could not be said to be the agency's approach but that of an individual officer. Trying to dispel the impression that ED wanted to keep the accused in jail, Raju said HC's order did not mean that there was no offence and that the case against Tripathi had been closed. He told the court that sanction had now been taken.The bench, however, said it could not allow ED to act like this and granted bail to the accused, but asked the trial court to put stringent conditions. It allowed the agency to seek cancellation of bail in case Tripathi did not cooperate in trial proceedings.","Supreme court grants bail to former bureaucrat arun kumar tripathi.

ITCX 2025: 32 lakh temples to come under one bloc to boost religious tourism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/32-lakh-temples-to-come-under-one-bloc-to-boost-religious-tourism/articleshow/118165073.cms,"Photo/Agencies

MUMBAI: In an unprecedented initiative, approximately 32 lakh temples worldwide, predominantly in India, encompassing an economy worth around Rs 6 lakh crore, are poised to establish a networking chain under a singular federation. This aims to develop, operate, and manage tourism and spiritual circuits systematically, ensuring temples become accessible to the general public in an efficient and transparent manner. To actualise this objective, the International Temples Convection and Expo (ITCX) 2025, the world's largest conclave dedicated to temple administration and management, is scheduled at Asha Conventions, Tirupati, between February 17 and 19. Organised in collaboration with Anthyodaya Pratishthan, the ITCX 2025 will amalgamate Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, and Jain institutions, providing a vibrant platform to network, fortify, and modernise temple ecosystems globally whilst preserving their rich cultural heritage .""Initially, it will witness participation from approximately 2000 devotional institutions across 58 countries and will showcase 111+ speakers, 15 workshops & knowledge sessions, and 60+ stalls at the expo. The convention, dubbed as 'Mahakumbh of Temples' - ITCX, endeavours to implement resolutions to enhance devotee experience by engaging, empowering, and augmenting the temple economy. ITCX 2025 will facilitate global collaboration between temple leaders, policymakers, and industry experts, focusing predominantly on progressive temple management beyond religious aspects,"" said Prasad Lad, Chairman of the ITCX. The ITCX has already reached over 12000 temples globally.Post-pandemic, spiritual tourism has taken centre stage with a substantial increase in the number of travellers worldwide. For instance, the Vaishno Devi Temple receives 32,000 to 40,000 pilgrims each day, up from 10,000 to 15,000 during the same period prior to the pandemic. Meanwhile, at least one lakh people visit the Golden Temple in Amritsar daily, surpassing pre-pandemic figures. A similar pattern is observed in the south at the Guruvayur Temple in Kerala, where daily visitors range from 6,000 to 7,000, compared to the pre-pandemic tally of 4,000. It is estimated that the travel and tourism industry alone employs more than 80 million people in India, with a year-on-year growth rate exceeding 19 per cent. The global religious tourism market is projected to reach USD 2.22 billion by 2032 with a CAGR of 6.25 per cent, a forecast by a KPMG study indicated.Topics to be discussed at the convention encompass a comprehensive range of temple operations, from fund management and crowd control to sustainability and security protocols, with particular emphasis on modernising temple management through AI, digital tools, and fintech solutions. Key focus areas include langar or food distribution systems, waste management and recycling, sustainable energy practices, and legal compliance. The discussions encompass essential community services such as medical aid, educational programmes, and charitable initiatives—all aimed at creating more efficient and socially impactful temple ecosystems, said Giresh Kulkarni, founder of Temple Connect, a platform for documenting and digitising information about temples of Indian origin.ITCX 2025 has secured support from the govt of India through the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture, and the Incredible India initiative, with Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) joining as presenting partner. The convention is additionally strengthened by the backing of the Archaeological Survey of India and Tourism & Endowments boards from Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, and other such Indian states. ""India, home to over 450,000 religious and cultural heritage sites, is a repository of pilgrimage and spiritual landmarks. Whilst some sites enjoy widespread recognition due to organic outreach, countless lesser-known religious destinations remain largely unexplored, hidden gems within local communities. However, religious fervour accounts for over 60% of domestic travel in India and especially post-pandemic, spiritual tourism has taken centre stage with a significant increase in the number of travellers worldwide,"" a KPMG study highlighted.""In line with the Prime Minister's vision of preserving Bharat's cultural and spiritual heritage, ITCX aims to bridge the gap between tradition and modern governance. They are more than places of worship; they are cultural and economic powerhouses. We firmly believe that every place of worship - no matter how small or remote, deserves access to world-class governance models that enhance their religious, cultural, and economic significance. ITCX provides administrators and policymakers with the necessary tools to enhance efficiency while preserving a temple's legacy,"" said Lad, who is also the Chief Whip of Maharashtra Legislative Council.","The international temples convection and expo (itcx) 2025 is scheduled at asha conventions, tirupati, between february 17 and 19. The convention, dubbed as 'mahakumbh of temples' - itcx, endeavours to implement resolutions to enhance devotee experience.

"Register land for hosiery unit or be present in court, SC tells WB chief Secy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/register-land-for-hosiery-unit-or-be-present-in-court-sc-tells-wb-chief-secy/articleshow/118197730.cms,"NEW DELHI: It is literally a 14-year-long kachcha-banian fight by a reputed hosiery manufacturing company to get hold of an acre of land in New Town, Kolkata. The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave an ultimatum to the West Bengal chief secretary – register the sale deed by March 2 or remain present in court.Rupa & Co were allotted the land in 2011 for establishing a modern showroom and manufacturing unit. It fully paid the cost of the land to the state government, but has been waiting since then, despite orders in its favour from Calcutta high court , for execution of the conveyance/sale deed, without which it cannot utilise the land.Senior advocate Nalin Kohli told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and A G Masih that a division bench of the HC had on Feb 10, 2020, ordered the state to register the allotted land in favour of Rupa. When the HC directions remained non-complied, the petitioner had filed repeated contempt petitions.Despite the HC judgment attaining finality and the only question remaining before the court was the implementation of its order, the HC rather surprisingly took note of the advocate general’s request for allotment of an alternative land of same area and referred the matter to mediation for amicable resolution, Kohli said and argued that such a course was not open for the HC in contempt proceeding.The bench agreed with the counsel and said if found the HC’s approach untenable, especially when the HC had on multiple occasions entertained contempt petitions and ruled that the state was bound to comply with its 2020 order.The bench said the HC could not have referred the matter for resolution through mediation solely based on the AG’s submissions, that too without the petitioner’s consent. “The majesty of law requires due obedience to the HC order, especially when the state’s appeal against it has been rejected by the SC,” Justice Gavai-led bench said.“This is a serious issue of maintaining the dignity and authority of the HC. Obedience of mandamus concerned. If the HC is not concerned about its dignity, then we are,” it said.Directing the state chief secretary to comply with the HC’s 2020 order by March 2 or remain present before it, the bench said it finds that the state’s approach in the case contumacious as it dared to seek the present market value of the land after the petitioner had succeeded before the HC and the SC.","The supreme court on wednesday gave an ultimatum to the west bengal chief secretary – register the sale deed by march 2 or remain present in court.

SC quashes NCH chairperson’s appointment; Khurana six months short of completing 4-year tenure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-quashes-nch-chairpersons-appointment-khurana-six-months-short-of-completing-4-year-tenure/articleshow/118197732.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed appointment of N K Khurana as the chairperson of National Commission for Homeopathy (NCH), who is six months shy of completing four-year term, finding that he did not meet the eligibility criteria and indicted AYUSH secretary for declaring Khurana eligible.The appointment of Khurana, whose term was to end in July this year, was set aside by a single judge bench of the Karnataka HC but he continued in the post as the single judge's decision was reversed by a division bench of the HC.On the appeal filed by Amaragouda L Patil, an unsuccessful contender for the chairman’s post, a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan found Khurana said the then AYUSH secretary, without any material, had in 2021 misled the selection committee that Khurana had the required experience when in reality he did not.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Devadatt Kamat and lawyer Nishant Patil said Khurana did not fulfil the eligibility criteria of “not less than 20 years in the field of Homeopathy, out of which at least 10 years shall be as a leader (as head of the department or the head of an organization) in the area of healthcare delivery.”After examining the documents relating to selection of candidates, three of whom were empaneled by the search committee including Amaragouda L Patil, the bench rejected Khurana’s claim that he was head of the department since 2008 and said, “It is plain and clear that he misrepresented his work experience for being considered for the coveted position of chairperson of the Commission.”Criticizing the Union govt for deviating from the mandatory eligibility criteria to favour Khurana, the bench said his appointment as chairperson despite not having the requisite experience suffers from malice in law.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, “We hasten to add that whenever appointment to a public office is sought to be made, irrespective of the nature of the office, the rules prescribing mandatory eligibility criteria must be applied in a strict manner; after all, every public appointment under Article 16 of the Constitution must be fair, non-arbitrary and reasonable. Tested on this touchstone, the appointment of the third respondent fails to pass muster.”Ordering Khurana to step down from the post in a week, the time given to enable him complete pending assignment without taking policy decisions, the bench asked the government to initiate a fresh process for selection of chairperson for NCH. It said though the past financial benefits would not be recovered from Khurana, he would not be entitled to any future financial benefit for holding the post of chairperson for 42 months.","Supreme court quashes appointment of n k khurana as the chairperson of national commission for homeopathy (nch) justices dipankar datta and manmohan found khurane said the then ayush secretary, without any material, had in 2021 misled the selection committee.

BHOPAL: Gwalior cyber police arrested three students from a hostel in Noida for alleged links with a syndicate that trapped a BSF officer in digital arrest for a month and scammed him of over Rs 71 lakh. The suspects were identified as Aftab Ahmed Khan, a BTech student from Jharkhand, Akhil Singh Bais, a BBA student from Delhi, and a class 12 student from Kota, Rajasthan.The racketeers, posing as Mumbai Crime Branch officers, had threatened to arrest the BSF inspector's wife and son and forced him into making 34 transactions. The victim - who is on the verge of retirement and now posted at BSF Academy in Tekanpur, Gwalior - was told that his Aadhaar card had been used for money laundering . Desperate to save his family, he sold off his flat, mortgaged his land and borrowed from friends.Gwalior cyber cops said the youngsters had been cyber-scamming people for two years. The money scammed was transferred to bank accounts in Karnataka, Aurangabad, and Gurgaon.Police said accused would persuade students to open bank accounts, which were then handed over to a Chinese gang. Some 20 accounts have been traced so far. When fraudulently obtained money was deposited, the accused would deduct a 6% commission and convert the remaining amount into USDT, which was then routed to the Chinese gang.","The suspects were identified as aftab ahmed khan, a btech student from jharkhand and akhil singh bais, a class 12 student from kota, rajasthan.

Marriages among close kin should be barred in any civilised society: SG

DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand high court has issued notices to the Centre and the state govt, directing them to respond within six weeks, while hearing public interest litigations challenging the provisions of the Uniform Civil Code that came into effect in the state last month. Among other submissions, the petitioners have claimed that the Act discriminates against Muslims.The PILs were filed by actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Dehradun-based brother Elmashuddin, Suresh Singh Negi from Bhimtal, and Ikram from Haridwar. They argued that the Act is ""discriminatory in nature since it takes away the customs and usage of the Muslim community by providing for restrictions to marry in 'degrees of prohibited relationship' as defined in the UCC"". They added that in the Muslim community, these restrictions do not exist and that marriage among relatives is permissible.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing virtually for the state government, pointed to the bench that Schedule 1 and 2 of the code, which define ""degrees of prohibited relationships"", include relationships such as mother, stepmother, daughter, son's widow, and other close relatives. He said, ""Such marriages among close relatives should be regulated by law and prohibited in any civilised society.""When the petitioners' lawyer, Kartikey Hari Gupta, contended that there should be no objection to permitting a Muslim man to marry his mother's sister's daughter or mother's brother's daughter, Mehta responded, ""For the petitioner to succeed on this ground, he will have to show a fundamental right of any individual to marry his sister, failing which he cannot challenge such a provision which is required in any civilised society.""The division bench consolidated two additional petitions challenging UCC on different grounds with this case and scheduled the matter for a hearing after six weeks. While Bhimtal resident and former student representative Suresh Singh Negi's PIL challenges numerous provisions of UCC, particularly those concerning live-in relationships, another PIL by Aarushi Gupta disputes the provisions related to marriage, divorce, and live-in relationships, asserting that they violate citizens' fundamental rights.The petitioners contested the mandatory registration of live-in relationships and the penal provisions for non-compliance, maintaining these requirements breach Right to Privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Mehta argued, ""Experience has shown that having lived in live-in relationships without any commitment, which results only from marriage, generally, the man deserts the woman, leaving her destitute and leaving the children born out of such relationships illegitimate.""He added that the code does not prohibit live-in relationships but regulates them by requiring registration. ""On such a registration, the child born out of such a live-in relationship is considered under UCC to be a legitimate child, and the deserted woman is given a right to approach the competent court seeking maintenance for herself and her child,"" Mehta said. On the petitioners' contention that the Act is discriminatory since it exempts people belonging to Scheduled Tribe, the SG said, ""Uniform Civil Code is not made applicable to the persons belonging to Scheduled Tribes in view of the specific protection granted in Part XXI of the Constitution and all Scheduled Tribes within the meaning of Clause 25 of Article 366 read with Article 342 form a separate class. Therefore, there is no discrimination.""","The uttarakhand high court has issued notices to the centre and the state govt.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the plea of Indrani Mukerjea , an accused in her daughter Sheena Bora murder's case, to travel abroad during pendency of the trial.Expressing doubt whether she will return to the country to face trial, a bench of Justices M M Sundaresh and Rajesh Bindal refused her request to go abroad and directed that the trial be concluded within one year, after which she could seek relief. ""There is no guarantee that you will come back,"" the bench observed.The court had earlier sought response from CBI on Mukerjea's plea to allow her to visit the UK and Spain to activate her bank accounts there and also to change her will after divorce.Mukerjea, a British citizen, alleged that her bank account in Spain had been deactivated and her biometrics were required to get it activated. She approached the apex court through her advocate Sana Raees Khan after Bombay HC quashed the trial court order allowing her to go abroad. She said she needed to get a new Eurobank account to enable her to pay pending taxes and bills in Spain and she was also required to change her will and power of attorney post her divorce.""CBI has realised that there is no case made out against the accused and as such, only with the intention of prolonging the trial, the prosecuting agency has been delaying the trial on one pretext or the other. There is no certainty of the number of witnesses, schedule of witnesses, time of conducting and concluding the trial, so on and so forth. The theory of the prosecution has been established to be nothing but a myth and the agency is completely directionless and clueless, and as such there is no likelihood of an early conclusion of the trial in the near future,"" Mukerjea said in her petition.On July 19, the trial court had allowed Mukerjea's plea to visit the UK and Spain for 10 days.
