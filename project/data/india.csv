Kids’ cough syrup deaths trigger multi-state checks

BHOPAL/NEW DELHI: As the number of children dying of renal failure in MP’s Chhindwara district after consumption of cough syrup rose to 11, with two more fatalities reported on Saturday, a laboratory test report of Coldrif — the cough medicine taken by some of the victims — has revealed it contained a poisonous industrial chemical, prompting the state to ban its sale.The report received by MP government from Tamil Nadu drugs control department on Saturday said the sample tested was “found adulterated, since it contains 48.6% diethylene glycol”. DEG, used in anti-freeze and brake fluids, is known to cause acute kidney failure and death when ingested.The state government immediately ordered a crackdown on Coldrif, manufactured by TN-based Sresan Pharmaceuticals, with the Food and Drugs Administration issuing urgent instructions to all drug inspectors to seize existing stocks, prevent further sales and draw samples from other batches for testing. The government also extended the prohibition to all other medicines made by the pharma company.MP CM Mohan Yadav, in an X post, said: “Death of children in Chhindwara caused by Coldrif syrup is extremely painful.” Late Saturday evening, he announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh for the families of each of the deceased children. The state government would also bear the cost of treatment for the children still under care, Yadav said.The cough-syrup-linked deaths in MP and Rajasthan have sounded alarm bells across the country, with several states announcing probes and taking precautionary measures.The Central Drug Standards Control Organisation has initiated risk-based inspection of drug manufacturing units in six states — Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, MP and Maharashtra. The inspections are focused on companies manufacturing cough syrups, antipyretics & antibiotics, samples of which were picked up by the drug regulatory authorities from regions from where the fatalities were reported.The deaths in Chhindwara have taken place over a period of one month. All the kids were aged below five years, and renal failure was reportedly caused after taking cough syrups, including Coldrif, were prescribed by local doctors at private clinics. Five kids are recuperating at Government Medical College & Hospital in Nagpur.The deaths, first reported in late Aug, were largely concentrated in villages in Parasia tehsil of Chhindwara. The children initially showed symptoms of cold and mild fever, and were treated with cough syrups and routine medicines. However, their condition worsened soon with reduced urine output and acute kidney complications.Union health ministry sources said a multidisciplinary team comprising experts from the National Institute of Virology, Indian Council of Medical Research, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, CDSCO and AIIMS-Nagpur, among others, were still analysing various samples and factors to assess the cause of deaths in and around Chhindwara.The ministry on Friday stated six samples tested by CDSCO and three by MP Food and Drugs Administration were found to be free of DEG and ethylene glycol. On Saturday, ministry sources clarified that the six “samples that have been tested so far by CDSCO were not of the two suspected cough syrups, including Coldrif, that have been under scanner”.The analysis of the samples of Coldrif and other suspected cough syrup by MP drug authorities is still underway.","The number of children dying of renal failure in mp’s chhindwara district after consumption of cough syrup rose to 11, with two more fatalities reported on saturday.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court will hear a plea filed by Ladakh-based climate activist Sonam Wangchuk ’s wife against his detention on October 6, ANI reported.The habeas corpus plea, filed by social entrepreneur Geetanjali Angmo, will be taken up by a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria.Wangchuk, a former educationist, was detained by police on September 26, two days after violent protests erupted in Ladakh’s capital Leh over demands for statehood and inclusion under the 6th Schedule of the Constitution of India. He was transferred to a jail in faraway Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).Authorities allege that Wangchuk “incited” the violence. At the time, he had been leading a hunger strike—which he later called off—advocating for statehood for Ladakh, a Union territory created in August 2019, and its inclusion in the 6th Schedule. On that day, a faction of mostly young protesters broke away from the peaceful agitation and engaged in clashes with security forces.Four protesters were killed in clashes with the police and CRPF, while several others—including security personnel—sustained injuries.","The supreme court will hear a plea filed by ladakh-based climate activist sonam wangchuk ’s wife against his detention on october 6.

Poll Have you or someone you know ever fallen victim to online investment fraud? Yes No

Some transactions layered via ‘fake import of services’

New Delhi: Its promoters are based in Russia, technical support in Georgia, its India operations are handled from Dubai and the servers are in Barcelona.Illegal online trading platform OctaFX, being investigated by Enforcement Directorate for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens, has become part of a unique study by the agency into transcontinental operations that convert proceeds of crime into cryptocurrencies and use services of international payment gateways.A multi-agency probe has revealed that over the past few years OctaFX, which deals in forex, commodities and cryptocurrencies and is incorporated in Cyprus, made Rs 800 crore of alleged proceeds of crime from its India operations in just nine months.Some of the transactions were layered through ""fake import of services"" from Singapore to launder duped funds generated in India. In a particular case, ED has attached Rs 172 crore worth of assets in India and abroad, including a yacht, a villa in Spain, Rs 36 crore in banks, 39,000 cryptocurrency (USDT), land and Demat holdings of Rs 80 crore.OctaFX, being investigated by the ED's Mumbai zonal unit, is not the only illegal online platform indulging in investment frauds.The others under probe include Power Bank, being investigated by the Bengaluru zonal unit; 'Angel One', TM Traders and Vivan Li, being investigated by the Kolkata zonal unit; and Zara FX, being investigated by the Kochi unit.The ED's cases are based on several FIRs registered by police in different cities.""Angel One is a SEBI-registered, publicly listed, and fully compliant financial services entity, and is not under any investigation by the Enforcement Directorate or any other regulatory or enforcement agency,"" a company spokesperson said. The reference in the article is to an illegal website which is spoofing many legal entities and committing frauds.""Cyber frauds in the name of cryptocurrency included Birfa IT and related firms acting as brokers, converting huge amounts of money to and from crypto to help clients send money to China for under-invoiced imports, laundering the PoC (proceeds of crime) through cryptocurrency,"" the ED study revealed.The probe further found that in the Birfa case ""remittances of Rs 4,818 crore were sent to Hong Kong and Canadian entities controlled by scammers, under the pretext of paying for leasing servers, escrow services, etc"" on fake invoices.The ED document estimated that Indians have lost more than Rs 22,800 crore in around 36.4 lakh financial frauds reported in 2024 - a more than 206% jump in estimated losses from Rs 7,465 crore in 2023 and an over 50% jump in number of cases from 24.4 lakh in that year.Investigation against a similar cyber investment fraud found that the masterminds, operating from Laos, Hong Kong and Thailand, hired agents in India to set up shell entities with forged papers and issued fake IPO allotments, stock market investments and indulged in fake digital arrests. PoC was collected in shell companies, converted into cryptocurrencies and remitted overseas as payment for fake ""import of services"".

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Friday demanded that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ’s diplomatic passport should be confiscated and legal action initiated.This comes after Gandhi's visit to Colombia, where he accused the BJP-led central government of mounting a “wholesale attack on Indian democracy” during an interaction at EIA University.Congress leader claimed that India’s diversity of religions, traditions and languages requires space for dialogue. Gandhi added that the democratic system is the best way to ensure this. According to him, the government’s actions are undermining this system and threatening the democratic fabric of the country.Dubey alleged that Gandhi makes baseless statements abroad criticizing the Indian government. The BJP leader claimed that Gandhi’s speeches on the Constitution and government policies were comparable to remarks made by controversial figures abroad.Speaking to reporters, BJP MP said: “Rahul Gandhi goes abroad and speaks at length about the Constitution and makes baseless statements against the Indian government. This is similar to what Zakir Naik is saying from Malaysia, and Khalistan terrorist Pannu from Canada and the US.”“I think the time has come for his diplomatic passport to be confiscated and legal action should be taken against him,” he added.Dubey also criticized Congress for opposing the arrest of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk , who was detained under the National Security Act in connection with the recent Leh violence in Ladakh.He alleged involvement of a “foreign power” behind Wangchuk’s activism and highlighted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had fulfilled Ladakh’s long-standing demand for Union Territory status.The BJP MP further slammed the Congress for historical actions during the Emergency, citing the imprisonment of former BJP leader Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia and 82-year-old freedom fighter and former Andhra Pradesh Governor Bhim Sen Sachar.In a post on X, Dubey has also accused the party of hypocrisy. He said that Congress now sheds “crocodile tears” for those arrested in Leh while having previously persecuted political opponents.Dubey also pointed out that while Congress speaks about women’s rights and democracy, the party’s actions during the Emergency told a different story.Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia and Maharani Gayatri Devi were imprisoned and harassed and 82-year-old Bhim Sen Sachar was also sent to jail.Senior Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, have urged the Centre to hold talks with the people of Ladakh, calling for a fair judicial inquiry into the violence that claimed four lives.Gandhi highlighted the case of a soldier’s son among the victims, demanding justice and condemning the government’s actions.Sonam Wangchuk is currently lodged in Jodhpur Central Jail following his detention under the National Security Act.",Bjp mp nishikant dubey has demanded that congress leader rahul gandhi’s diplomatic passport should be confiscated and legal action initiated.

Such vehicles and driving licence holders will also be flagged as “not to be transacted” on Vahan and Sarathi portal.Sources said these changes have been proposed to nudge violators to clear their dues.However, experts cautioned that, before implementing the changes, the govt must ensure that systems are in place for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) holders to raise objections against challans, and for their names to be promptly removed from the pending payment list once the dues are cleared.“The draft rules specify that anyone receiving a challan may contest it on the portal with supporting documentary evidence before an authority designated by the respective state govt.There is a need to clearly define the responsibilities of this authority, and there should be a penalty provision in place if the authority fails to remove a vehicle or individual from the defaulter list after dues have been cleared,” said a veteran from the transport industry.The ministry has proposed that police officers in uniform or any other official authorised by state govts be allowed to issue challan physically. They could also auto-generate challans. These challans must be delivered either in person within 15 days or electronically within three days.If a person does not contest a challan before the designated authority, it will be deemed accepted 45 days after issuance.According to the draft rules, if a challan is contested and the authority fails to resolve it within 30 days, or if it decides to quash the challan with recorded reasons, the penalty will no longer be enforceable.The petitioner may either accept the order and pay the fine within 30 days of it being uploaded on the portal or file an application before a court after depositing 50 per cent of the penalty amount. If the individual neither pays the fine nor contests the challan in court within 30 days of receiving the order, the challan will be deemed accepted.",Road transport ministry proposes changes to mv rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.

Of 796 convicted foreigners in Bengal’s prisons, 204 are women

KOLKATA: West Bengal houses the highest number of foreign prisoners in the country. As many as 2,508, or 36%, of India’s 6,956 foreign prisoners are lodged in the state’s correctional homes, according to ‘Prison Statistics of India 2023’, released by the National Crime Records Bureau.As many as 89% of the foreigners detained in Bengal’s prisons, mostly Bangladeshis, have been prosecuted for illegally entering India.Foreigners make up 9% of Bengal’s total prison population of 25,774. Of the Bangladeshis lodged here, 778 are convicts and 1,440 undertrials. Myanmar takes second spot. Most undertrials are between 18 and 30 years of age.With more than half of the 4,906-km-long India-Bangladesh border falling in Bengal, the state has had to lodge a large percentage of foreign prisoners. While there were 796 foreign convicts in the state’s jails in 2023, there were 1,499 undertrials.In fact, NCRB data points to the fact that the country’s prisons have been housing more and more undertrials.According to a legal aid counsel, the rise in undertrial numbers has multiple reasons, including being unable to afford a counsel, absence of jurisdiction benches, and already overburdened trial courts.“Illegal Bangladeshi detainees are pushed back on the orders of the Foreigners Regional Registration Office.In Bengal, however, deportation remains abysmally low, despite our repeated pleas,” a senior state official said.Bengal’s prisons are overcrowded, with the occupancy rate being 120% in 2023. As many as 60 prisons, with a total capacity of 21,476, housed 25,774 inmates (nationals and foreigners). The only women’s jail in the state had an occupancy rate of 110.2%. Of the 796 foreign national convicts in Bengal’s prisons, 204 are women and 12 transgender persons.In the case of undertrials, there were 371 women and nine transgender persons out of 1,499 inmates.","As many as 2,508, or 36%, of india’s 6,956 foreign prisoners are lodged in the state.

Government seeks views on including PDS food grains in CPI series,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-seeks-views-on-including-pds-food-grains-in-cpi-series/articleshow/124314950.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Statistics ministry Saturday floated a discussion paper and invited views from experts, academicians, government bodies, states, financial institutions and other stakeholders on treatment of items distributed free of cost through PDS in the consumer price index compilation framework.The ministry is currently undertaking a revision of the CPI with the objective of updating item weights, revising the consumption basket and incorporating methodological improvements to strengthen the index. At present, the CPI is compiled every month on the basis of price data collection from 1,181 rural markets and 1,114 urban centres across the country.With the release of household consumption expenditure survey 2023-24, the ministry has also kicked off the exercise to revise the CPI base year from 2012 to 2024.Including items distributed through the PDS in the retail inflation basket is a crucial issue as it could have a bearing on the actual headline inflation outcome.In the existing CPI series, items that are distributed free of cost do not carry any expenditure share, since households incur zero out-of-pocket spending on them. This is consistent with international practice, according to the discussion paper which asked stakeholders to send in their comments by Oct 22. The paper states CPI serves a dual purpose in India.It is not only the principal indicator for monetary policy formulation by RBI , but also widely used as a proxy for tracking changes in cost of living and for indexation of wages, pensions and formulation of social welfare schemes.","The ministry is currently undertaking a revision of the cpi with the objective of updating item weights, revising the consumption basket and incorporating methodological improvements to strengthen the index.

NEW DELHI: Unique Identification Authority of India waived off all charges for mandatory biometric update of Aadhaar for children, an official statement said on Saturday. The fee waiver has kicked in effective Oct 1 and will be in force for a period of one year.""In a pro-people measure, UIDAI has waived off all charges for Mandatory Biometric Update, a move that is expected to benefit around six crore children,"" an official statement said.A child under the age of five enrols for Aadhaar by providing the photograph, name, date of birth, gender, address and birth certificate. The fingerprints and iris biometrics of a child are not captured for Aadhaar enrolment below the age of five because these are not mature at that age.""As per existing rules, fingerprints, iris and photo are mandatorily required to be updated in Aadhaar when a child reaches the age of five. This is called the first Mandatory Biometric Update (MBU). Similarly, a child is required to update biometrics once again upon reaching the age of 15, which is referred to as the second MBU. The first and second MBUs, if performed between 5-7 and 15-17 years of age, respectively, are thus free of cost. Thereafter, a prescribed fee of Rs 125 per MBU is charged. With this decision, MBU is now effectively free for all children in the age group of 5-17,"" the statement said.","The fee waiver has kicked in effective oct 1 and will be in force for a period of one year.

NEW DELHI: After resisting for years the release of the answer key immediately after the preliminary examination, UPSC has given in to students' demands and told Supreme Court it will publish a provisional answer key after the exam ""to enhance transparency in its functioning"", and will entertain objections of candidates on discrepancies in the exam paper.The declaration was made in an affidavit filed by UPSC in Supreme Court on a batch of petitions by civil services aspirants from across the country.The petitioners, including Vidushi Pandey from Uttarakhand, had moved court seeking that the answer key be released immediately after the exam and before declaration of results, so that candidates can raise objections, and errors can be corrected on time.At present, the key is published after the final examination, almost a year after the preliminary exam, and virtually shuts the door on candidates seeking a remedy for any fault in the question paper.That as a consequence of comprehensive deliberation and considering the pious role assigned to the UPSupreme Court as a constitutional body, the Commission has arrived at a conscious and well-considered decision as under:a) Publishing the Provisional Answer key, after the Preliminary Examination is conducted;b) Representations/objections will be sought from the candidates who appeared in the examination.Each such representation/objection should be supported by three authoritative sources..., the affidavit said.The students have been fighting the legal battle for the last two years and the commission had at first strongly objected to their plea.It finally relented after senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, who was appointed by the Supreme Court as amicus curiae, told the court that greater transparency was needed in the examination process and suggested that a provisional answer key be published a day after the examination and examinees be allowed to file objections to the questions as well as the answers within a week.","The declaration was made in an affidavit filed by upsc in supreme court on a batch of petitions by civil services aspirants from across the country.
