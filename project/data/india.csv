FARIDABAD: There was no foreboding of the extraordinary day that would reduce the Mehtos from a family of six to one.Not even that morning. June 10 bore the stamp of routine. The boys took their usual morning baths before the heatwave made an oven of their room. Their mother made parathas for breakfast. Their father, Manoj Mehto, lazed, ambled around the alley, spoke to a few neighbours. Like he did on days he did not go to work, which would be twice or thrice a week.""It was a normal Tuesday morning,"" Preeti told TOI on Wednesday, alone in a house - in fact, a room- where four boys and two adults packed in, each with a few inches marked out to sleep or sit, bedroom, living room and kitchen rolled into one.The little room in Subhash Colony would allow no secrets, at least not within its confines. As people living in other such dwellings on the road put it, it's so cramped that even thoughts could get heard.And yet, the storm raging in 36-year-old Mehto's mind made no noise. Preeti has to think hard to remember if anything was amiss. Yes, it was odd of him to put on new clothes. But it had seemed in tune with what Preeti read as a jovial mood and a desire to take the boys out to a park.""You come too,"" he insisted to her, speaking of a 'family outing'.""But I wasn't feeling well and had a lot of work to do at home, so I refused. I told him to take the children out. They all left and never returned...,"" a distraught Preeti said as neighbours crowded the house with one question - why?Preeti did not have an answer.Manoj had not gone to the park. He bought chips and cola and headed for the railway tracks nearby. The five of them sat on the tracks under the Elson Chowk flyover. The boys had no inkling of what was to happen. For close to an hour, they sat there. One of the most horrifying deaths the country has seen unfolded next as a train - Golden Temple Express - ran them over. The boys, according to witnesses, struggled to be released but Mehto held on firm, making sure all five of them would be right in line when the train came. He had made his younger sons Chotu (3) and Murli (5) sit on his shoulders and held Pawan (10) and Kaaro (7) by their arms.Police have initiated an inquest and are still searching for a motive. After questioning different people, police officers said they had come to know that Manoj might have had some ""trust issues"" and was particularly peeved with a neighbour of Preeti's parents back at their home in Bihar's Lakhisarai who helped take her messages to them.""Preeti's parents did not have mobile phones, so she would call the neighbour, a man she refers to as a 'cousin', and request him to help her get in touch with them. There was nothing more to it,"" said Rajender Singh, in charge of the railway police post in Ballabgarh.The couple's neighbours in Subhash Colony said they hadn't heard any arguments between Manoj and Preeti. Preeti told police she didn't have any recent disagreement with Manoj. The two had fallen in love and got married 11 years ago.""We got married, and my sister married Manoj's brother. We shifted here (Faridabad) three years ago, and I stayed at home because he always asked me not to take a job and raise his kids well,"" Preeti said.Seema Devi, a neighbour who visited the couple's house on Wednesday, said she didn't know the family, but came to convey her condolences. ""We are all shattered by this very disturbing incident. I came to pay condolences and wanted to know what led the man to make such a decision,"" she said.A police officer said Mehto's and the boys' bodies are currently at the mortuary of BK Civil Hospital. ""Manoj's brother requested us to wait for the autopsy till he arrives in Faridabad. He will reach on Thursday, after which the post-mortem examination will be conducted,"" he said.","Manoj mehto waited with his four sons till the train crushed them. The boys, according to witnesses, struggled to be released but mehto held on firm. The five of them sat on the tracks under the elson chowk flyover. For close to an hour, they sat there.

BHOPAL: The design of the newly constructed Aishbagh railway overbridge in Bhopal has come under scrutiny, with experts raising concerns and state minister Vishwas Sarang set to visit the site on 14 June for inspection.The overbridge is not yet open to traffic. Officials are considering correcting the identified issues before its formal inauguration. Similar concerns had earlier been raised about the Ganesh Mandir–Gayatri Mandir flyover, which was inaugurated by chief minister Mohan Yadav.Following media reports and expert inputs, some engineers involved in that project were suspended.“The turn in the middle of the overbridge at the right angle is an issue. Bhaiya (Sarang) has taken up the issue with engineers involved in the project and correction as required would be made in the design,” said Mukesh Lodhi, PRO to Sarang. He confirmed the minister’s scheduled visit.Retired chief engineer, PWD, V K Amar, told, “Design of the overbridge is glaringly faulty. Whenever there is a turn on an overbridge, you give a curve so as to alert the driver about the turn ahead but here, you have a turn on the right angle without any curve and any driver would be taken by surprise at the turn and it would become an accident-prone area.""""The design will have to be altered by giving a curve 100 metres ahead of the actual turn, so that a driver is ready for the turn as it arrives,"" he said.The Rs 18 crore overbridge was completed after an eight-year delay. Local residents have also raised concerns.“Residents waited ten years for this bridge. Instead of relief upon its completion, the community raised significant safety issues. The primary concern centres on the sharp 90-degree turn at the bridge’s peak, which vehicles must traverse, posing considerable risks,” said Aslam, a resident of Aishbagh locality.Railway authorities clarified that their responsibility was limited to the section over the tracks. “We are responsible for the bridges built over the railway tracks. The approach roads of the bridge were built by PWD,” said Nawal Agrawal, PRO of Bhopal Railway Division.An engineer associated with the project, speaking toon condition of anonymity, cited limited space and the presence of a nearby metro station as factors behind what he described as a “distinctive design”.PWD officials said an inspection team had assessed the site and would submit a report.

Who is Zeeshan Akhtar

Zeeshan Akhtar is a 22-year-old from Punjab.

He is accused of being a key conspirator in Baba Siddique’s murder.

Police say Akhtar planned the killing, managed finances through more than 10 bank accounts, and coordinated with other accused.

He worked closely with jailed shooter Gurmel Singh and helped arrange weapons and shelter for the attackers.

Akhtar reportedly left Mumbai a month before the murder to avoid raising suspicion.

He is linked to the Lawrence and Anmol Bishnoi gang.

Akhtar is the second accused to be detained in Canada after Anmol Bishnoi.

Zeeshan Akhtar has been detained in Canada in connection with the murder of NCP politician Baba Siddique. Akhtar was reportedly held on the basis of an Interpol notice and has been in Canadian police custody for over a week.Baba Siddique, 66, was shot dead on October 12 last year outside his son's office in Bandra (East), Mumbai. Three assailants carried out the attack. His son had alleged that a builder lobby involved in a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project was responsible, but police ruled out this angle. Instead, their chargesheet pointed to Lawrence Bishnoi's Canada-based brother Anmol as the mastermind, linking the murder to Siddique's alleged connections with Dawood Ibrahim and actor Salman Khan.So far, 26 people have been arrested from different parts of the country, including Pune, Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich, Haryana, Dombivli and Karjat. They include Shivkumar Gautam alias Shiva, who is accused of firing the shots. All 26 are facing charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).","Zeeshan akhtar, 22, is accused of being a key conspirator in baba siddique's murder.

SRINAGAR: Srinagar’s Tagore Hall reverberated with chants of ‘Lal Salam’ on Wednesday as CPM held a one-day convention calling for the restoration of Article 370 and initiation of dialogue with Pakistan.The convention stood out as a rare political event in Kashmir Valley, where even most of the regional parties have largely shifted discourse to demanding the restoration of statehood rather than raising the issue of restoring J&K’s special status.Addressing party workers at the event, titled ‘Convention for the Restoration of Legitimate Constitutional Rights of the People of Jammu and Kashmir’, CPM general secretary M Alexander Baby said the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to J&K, amounted to betrayal. “Before adding it into the Constitution of India, Article 370 was thoroughly deliberated upon and agreed to,” Baby said.He hit out at Union home minister Amit Shah for claiming that the abrogation of Article 370 had brought peace and development to Kashmir.Baby, accompanied by several party MPs and other functionaries, also visited border areas in Uri to assess the destruction caused by Pakistani shelling during Operation Sindoor.He said the compensation offered to affected residents was inadequate. “Govt is providing only Rs 1.3 lakh for damaged houses and residential structures. That amount is meagre,” he said, adding that party MPs would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha.The CPM leader, who also met family members of Adil Shah, the ponywallah killed in Pahalgam terror attack, said Kashmiris had been fighting terrorism for years, but the current administration had marginalised elected representatives of the state. During the security review meetings, it’s the LG, a nominee of the Centre, who chaired the meeting, while the elected chief minister Omar Abdullah was excluded, Baby said, adding that “this only emboldens the terrorists”.Baby asserted that terrorism must be fought, but war was not a solution. “Military options are limited. On May 7, certain steps were taken, but we must stop there and begin negotiations,” he said, calling for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan. Rejecting any third-party intervention, he said US President Donald Trump shouldn’t have any role.CPM leader from Kashmir, M Y Tarigami, also criticised the central govt for bifurcating J&K and stripping it of statehood and special status. “This is the only region in the country where such a reversal (from state to Union Territory) has happened. Elsewhere, UTs have been upgraded to full states,” Tarigami said.",Srinagar’s tagore hall reverberated with chants of ‘lal salam’ on wednesday.

A complicated family dynamic with children from multiple relationships

Balancing NFL stardom with fatherhood isn’t always easy





Tyreek Hill may be known to NFL fans as the explosive wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, but off the field, the 31-year-old juggles an equally demanding role: being a father to seven children. Known as ""Cheetah"" for his unmatched speed, Hill’s family life has often sparked headlines—not just for the number of children he has, but also for the complexities that come with raising them while maintaining a high-profile sports career.Tyreek Hill reportedly shares his seven children with multiple women, including his now estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro. Their youngest, Capri, was born in 2024. Before Vaccaro, Hill was in a long-term relationship with Crystal Espinal, with whom he shares three children: Zev (born in 2014), and twins Nakeem and Nyla (born in 2017). The twins were born after the couple had split, which led Espinal to file a paternity suit to dispel rumors surrounding the timeline of their breakup and the children’s birth.Despite the legal complexities, Hill embraced fatherhood wholeheartedly. “I just feel like I’m truly blessed,” he told USA Today in 2020. “Each and every day I get up, I get a chance to play the game that I love, be around people who are loving, and then I get a chance to be around my kids and be in their lives.I feel like I’m truly blessed.""Managing life as a professional athlete and a father to seven kids is no small feat. Hill candidly discussed this during a 2023 appearance on the It Needed to be Said podcast. “Earlier in my career, bro, I'd come home and my kids would be like, ‘Dad, it's play time, let's play, let's play, let's run around.’ I'm like, 'Bro, I'm tired. Your dad is tired.' Like I got to learn these plays and I gotta watch these films.""These struggles reveal a more human side to the NFL superstar—one that fans rarely see behind the game-day highlights and touchdowns. Over time, Hill has adjusted to the demands of being both a dedicated father and an elite athlete.Also Read: NFL legend Brett Favre opens up on Parkinson’s battle and reveals heartbreaking fear and blames NFL for the diagnosis As Hill prepares for another NFL season, one thing is clear: while the field may be where he shines, home is where his heart—and his biggest challenges—truly lie.","Tyreek hill is an nfl wide receiver for the miami dolphins.

Rajkot mourns demise of ex-CM Rupani, its friendly neighbour

GANDHINAGAR: For Gujarat's former chief minister Vijay Rupani , the number 1206 was a symbol of fortune, a silent companion through the years. He believed in it with a tender faith. The registration plates of all his vehicles - scooters and cars - had 1206 on them. Friends say it had always been his lucky charm.But fate gave it a cruel twist. On June 12 - 12/06 - the same number that followed him for decades marked the day his journey ended. Rupani was aboard the AI flight that crashed moments after takeoff from Ahmedabad. He was en route to London to meet his wife and daughter. He never arrived. The ex-CM, now the party in charge of Punjab, had put off his visit to the UK from June 5 to 12, owing to Ludhiana West bypoll on June 19, said Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar.""This is very unfortunate. This is how destiny and fate play out that he came into harm's way. He was to leave along with his wife on June 5, but rescheduled his visit to campaign for Ludhiana West bypoll,"" Jakhar told TOI.In Rajkot, the city ex-CM Vijay Rupani had served and loved, the news settled like a slow, heavy fog. He wasn't just a political figure - he was a familiar face, a neighbour, a man who had time for everyone.Those who knew him remember his humility more than his achievements. He had been instrumental in key development works - the new airport, AIIMS - but it was his quiet presence, his unwavering availability, that left a deeper mark.""He was a tall neta, yes,"" said Sanjay Mehta, a neighbour. ""But he lived like one of us. Always kind. Always ready to help. You'd never know he held such a big position. To us, he was Vijaybhai - our neighbour, friend.""Politicians from across the political spectrum condoled Rupani's death and paid tribute. Authorities involved in rescue and relief operations confirmed he was among the dead.His nephew Mehul Rupani said, ""The family is devastated to know about the sad demise of uncle. Anjali aunty (Rupani's wife) and her daughter are returning from London, as are other relatives from the US. We will follow the processes as advised by govt to take custody of his mortal remains. Family is in shock.""Rupani's personal assistant Shailesh Mandaliya, who dropped him off at the airport, said, ""Few minutes after dropping him, we heard the news.""Born on Aug 2, 1956 in Yangon, Myanmar into a Jain family, Rupani, was the seventh and youngest child.

They are a key component in elevated metro rail corridors, typically laid between concrete piers to support track slabs above.The A-frame, which failed in this instance, is a temporary steel structure used during construction to hold the girder in place until it is permanently secured.

The Mississippi Museum of Natural Science (MMNS) is calling the public to slither into discovery at its annual World Snake Day celebration, which this year will take place on Friday, June 13, 2025. The event provides participants with an exclusive chance to meet live snakes, learn from experienced naturalists, and uncover the ecological significance of these much-maligned reptiles.While World Snake Day is officially observed on July 16, museum authorities have advanced their celebration to an early date because of climatic issues in observing some snakes during the hottest part of the summer.explained Aaron Holbrook, MMNS Assistant Director.The museum's timing of holding the event during mid-June as opposed to July is strategic. Numerous indigenous species of snakes will seek refuge underground during peak summer heat, becoming less accessible and harder to display for educational exposure.“Once the heat kicks in, a lot of these species go underground to escape it,” Holbrook explained. “By holding the event earlier, we’re able to introduce the public to a wider variety of species, including some rarely seen in the wild. ”Some of the snakes showcased in the event form part of the permanent collection of the museum, while others are temporarily harvested from the wild for use in education purposes and responsibly released back to their natural habitats afterwards.The MMNS World Snake Day celebration promises a combination of education, conservation messaging, and entertainment that is family-friendly. People will be able to:MMNS has a mission to change people's attitudes about snakes from fear to respect by emphasizing their vital role in ensuring healthy ecosystems. From pest control to balancing biodiversity, snakes offer natural services that are beneficial to agriculture, public health, and native wildlife.""The more we learn about these animals, the better we can conserve them—and ourselves,"" Holbrook said. Along with live demonstrations, the museum will offer materials that address frequent misconceptions like:These subjects will also be addressed in The Clarion-Ledger's upcoming Snake Week, a special daily series of articles on snake science, conservation concerns, and recent wildlife encounters throughout the state.Adults: $9Seniors (60+): $8Children (3–18): $7Children 3 and under and MMNS Foundation members: FreeFood and refreshments will be available for sale from Spotter's Snack Shack, on the grounds.Whether you are an inquisitive child, a wildlife conservationist, or just someone wanting to overcome your fear of snakes, MMNS World Snake Day presents a unique and interactive experience with some of nature's most intriguing reptiles.

Houston Texans safety Jimmie Ward was arrested in Texas on a felony family assault charge just as the team wrapped up mandatory minicamp

Jimmie Ward’s off-field reputation under spotlight after felony assault arrest in Texas





Just as the Houston Texans were closing out their offseason program on Thursday morning, unexpected news broke involving one of their veteran leaders. Safety Jimmie Ward, a 12-year NFL veteran and former first-round pick, was arrested in the early hours of June 12 in Magnolia, Texas. The charge? Third-degree felony family assault with allegations of impeding breathing—an incident that now places Ward’s immediate future in question as the Texans head into a pivotal 2025 season.According to jail records from the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office, Jimmie Ward was taken into custody at 5:38 a.m. Thursday and officially booked at 6:37 a.m. He remains held without bond as of Thursday evening.The arrest charge stems from an alleged domestic altercation that escalated to the point of “impeding breathing,” which elevated the incident to a third-degree felony under Texas law.When reached for comment, Texans senior director of communications Omar Majzoub told NFL.com on Thursday, “We are aware of the report involving Jimmie Ward. We are gathering information and have no further comment at this time.”The 33-year-old defensive back was in his third season with Houston after signing a two-year contract with the team in 2023. Prior to joining the Texans, Ward spent nine years with the San Francisco 49ers, who selected him 30th overall in the 2014 NFL Draft.In 126 career games—99 of them starts—he has amassed 549 tackles, 51 passes defensed, and 10 interceptions.In the 2024 season, Ward started 10 games for Houston, logging 48 tackles, four pass breakups, two interceptions, and a defensive touchdown. He was expected to be a key contributor in the Texans’ secondary again this season.Known as “Neko” to friends and fans alike—a name he also uses on his Instagram—Ward has largely maintained a low profile off the field. Though not frequently active on social media, his last post in February was a brand collaboration.In November 2024, he was recognized for participating in a local anti-bullying event at an elementary school, where he addressed students and posed with the Texans’ mascot. “Thank you @texanstoro1 for having me help out with this initiative. Let’s keep attacking bullying together,” he wrote on Instagram at the time.Ward's agent has not responded to media inquiries, and no official legal statement has been released on his behalf.The arrest casts a shadow over what was expected to be a leadership-driven year for Ward, who is entering the final season of his contract. While the Texans have yet to comment further, the timing—on the final day of mandatory minicamp—adds a layer of disruption to an otherwise focused offseason. With the legal process now underway, questions loom about Ward’s availability come training camp and beyond.Also Read: Philadelphia Eagles' Jihaad Campbell faces setback—but Nick Sirianni hints at star potential upon return","Jimmie ward was arrested in the early hours of june 12 in magnolia, texas.
