Ex-CM Baghel's son got Rs 250 crore as his share from Chhattisgarh liquor 'scam': Chargesheet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-cm-baghels-son-got-rs-250-crore-as-his-share-from-chhattisgarh-liquor-scam-chargesheet/articleshow/126132442.cms,"RAIPUR: Chaitanya, son of former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel , received Rs 200 crore to Rs 250 crore as his share from an alleged liquor scam in the state, the Anti-Corruption Bureau/Economic Offence Wing (ACB/EOW) has claimed in its chargesheet.The state police's ACB/EOW, in its seventh supplementary chargesheet in the multi-crore liquor scam filed before a special court here on Monday, claimed Chaitanya Baghel played a key role in establishing, coordinating, and protecting an extortion racket (syndicate) within the excise department (during the previous Congress government, which was in office from 2018-23).The voluminous document, running into around 3,800 pages, has named Chaitnaya Baghel as an accused in the alleged scam pegged at more than Rs 3,000 crore, an ACB/EOW statement said.With this, a total of eight chargesheets have been filed in the case so far.The latest chargesheet details the current status of the investigation against the arrested accused, along with digital evidence reports about all those in custody. The document also outlines the progress of the ongoing probe against the accused persons.The statement quoting the chargesheet said Chaitanya Baghel acted as coordinator among officials such as Anil Tuteja, Soumya Chaurasia, Arunpati Tripathi, and Niranjan Das, who worked in line with the syndicate's interests at the administrative level and as ground-level operatives of the network, such as Anwar Dhebar, Arvind Singh, and Vikas Agarwal (all co-accused), and issued instructions to them.Chaitanya Baghel worked through his trusted associates to transfer and manage proceeds of the scam collected by businessman Anwar Dhebar's team, moving the funds to higher levels, it claimed.He allegedly received his share of the proceeds through various firms belonging to liquor businessman Trilok Singh Dhillon, transferring it through banking channels to his family firms and using it in real estate projects.Furthermore, he was also found to have received and invested large sums of money generated out of the scam through banking channels via his family members, friends, and associates, the chargesheet claimed.The probe agency said, ""Evidence indicates that Chaitanya, along with managing the proceeds of the crime at a higher level, received around Rs 200 crore-Rs 250 crore as his share.""The investigation has also revealed that high-level protection, policy/administrative intervention, and influence provided to the syndicate by Chaitanya Baghel enabled this crime to be perpetrated for a long period, it claimed.""The ongoing investigation suggests the amount involved in the liquor scam is estimated to be approximately Rs 3,074 crore. However, further investigation suggests the total amount of the proceeds of crime generated out of the alleged scam could exceed Rs 3,500 crore,"" it added.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing the money laundering angle in the alleged scam, arrested Chaitanya Baghel on July 18 following a search at his house, which he shares with his father, a Congress politician, in Bhilai town of Durg district.As per the ED's prosecution complaint (chargesheet) filed earlier, Chaitanya Baghel ""handled"" more than Rs 1,000 crore worth of ""proceeds of crime"" generated from a liquor ""scam"" in the state.The central agency has stated that the alleged scam resulted in a ""massive loss"" to the state exchequer and filled the pockets of beneficiaries of a liquor syndicate.The scam was orchestrated between 2019 and 2022 when then-CM Bhupesh Baghel headed the Congress government in Chhattisgarh.Money was ""illegally"" collected from ""every"" bottle of liquor sold in Chhattisgarh (between 2019 and 2022), said the anti-money laundering agency.Chaitanya Baghel was arrested by the ACB/EOW in September while he was in jail under judicial custody.The ED in January arrested former excise minister and Congress leader Kawasi Lakhma, businessman Anwar Dhebar (brother of Congress leader and former Raipur Mayor Aijaz Dhebar), former IAS officer Anil Tuteja, Indian Telecom Service (ITS) officer Arunpati Tripathi and a few others as part of their probe in the case.The EOW/ACB registered an FIR on January 17, 2024, in the alleged scam, naming 70 individuals and companies, including Lakhma and former chief secretary Vivek Dhand.After his son was arrested, former CM Baghel claimed that the action was taken because the Congress, during its rule, tried to stop the cutting of forests and mining activities in the state.The Congress leader also alleged that the probe agencies were being misused to target Opposition leaders.

"IIT, Australian university develop nanotech drug delivery for breast cancer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-australian-university-develop-nanotech-drug-delivery-for-breast-cancer/articleshow/126131585.cms,"Representative image

CHENNAI: A tiny needle system that sends cancer drugs directly into breast cancer cells, while protecting healthy ones, has been developed by researchers from IIT Madras and two Australian universities - Monash University and Deakin University. The nanotechnology injection delivery system packs the anticancer drug, doxorubicin, into special protective bubbles, then pushes it inside cells using needle-shaped silicon tubes on a chip.""It was a study on petri dishes,"" said IIT-M assistant professor Dr Swathi Sudhakar, who works with the department of applied mechanics and biomedical engineering. ""We could release the drug directly, but that would be faster delivery. So, for sustained release, it was wrapped in a bubble and pushed into it. Lab tests on breast cancer cells showed the drugs stopped cell growth, killed cancer cells, and blocked new blood vessels for tumours,"" Dr Sudhakar said.Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer affecting women in both urban and rural areas. In cities such as Chennai, 28% of cancers in women are breast cancers, followed by cervix (14%), ovary (6%), and corpus uteri (4%).Conventional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation often harm non-cancerous tissues due to systemic drug exposure, causing side effects.Results of the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Materials Interfaces show the new system worked 23 times better than the drug alone. ""It had higher potential even when used in smaller amounts. There is thermal stability and long-term drug release, up to 700 hours, and it addresses common drawbacks of existing nanocarrier systems, such as burst release and poor compatibility,"" she said.The technology, they said, is a reliable and scalable candidate for future trials.","A tiny needle system sends cancer drugs directly into breast cancer cells, while protecting healthy ones.

"Sleep loss, stress, obesity emerging as key risks for breast cancer: ICMR study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sleep-loss-stress-obesity-emerging-as-key-risks-for-breast-cancer-icmr-study/articleshow/126131535.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Disrupted sleep, rising stress levels and central obesity are emerging as major drivers of India's growing breast cancer burden, which is projected to rise by 5.6% annually and add nearly 50,000 new cases every year, according to a major new study by the ICMR-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research.The systematic review and meta-analysis analysed Indian studies published up to Dec 22, 2024, to identify population-specific risk factors. Of nearly 1,900 scientific papers screened, 31 observational studies of moderate to high quality were included.Among lifestyle-related factors, individual studies showed a positive association between breast cancer risk and poor sleep quality, irregular sleep patterns, sleeping in illuminated rooms and high stress levels - reflecting the impact of urbanisation and changing work-life patterns. Regular physical activity, the researchers noted, was consistently associated with a lower risk.Central obesity was identified as a critical factor, with women having a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.85 or higher facing significantly elevated risk. Abdominal fat, researchers noted, plays a more decisive role than overall body weight, particularly among postmenopausal women.Clinicians say these lifestyle shifts are increasingly shaping breast cancer patterns in India.Dr Samit Purohit, director of medical oncology at Action Cancer Hospital, said breast cancer is no longer driven only by age or inherited risk. ""Disrupted sleep cycles, chronic stress and central obesity are becoming silent but powerful contributors, as they alter hormonal balance, immune surveillance and inflammatory pathways,"" he said, adding that irregular sleep suppresses melatonin-a hormone with protective anti-cancer properties-while chronic stress leads to sustained cortisol elevation and metabolic dysfunction.The meta-analysis also found strong links with reproductive and hormonal factors, including late menopause (after 50 years), delayed first pregnancy or childbirth (after 30), multiple abortions and higher age at marriage, all of which increase lifetime hormonal exposure. Family history of cancer, particularly breast cancer, emerged as one of the strongest predictors of risk.Researchers noted India's breast cancer risk profile differs from Western populations, where hormone replacement therapy and early menarche are dominant factors. In India, the convergence of lifestyle disruption, reproductive delay and metabolic risk is reshaping disease patterns.The study called for large, population-based prospective cohort studies and stronger emphasis on prevention and early screening.","India's breast cancer burden is projected to rise by 5.6% annually and add nearly 50,000 new cases every year.

Mahayuti sweeps Phase 1 of Maharashtra local body polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahayuti-sweeps-phase-1-of-maharashtra-local-body-polls/articleshow/126109839.cms,"Image: IANS

BJP-Led Mahayuti Sweeps Maharashtra Local Body Polls; PM Modi, CM Fadnavis Hail Victory

PUNE/NAGPUR: BJP-led Mahayuti delivered a sweeping verdict after two rounds of the first phase of Maharashtra's civic elections, winning presidents' posts in nearly 207 of 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats, mirroring its assembly election performance just over a year ago. Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) was reduced to 44 posts.Results were declared on Sunday after polling on Dec 2 and 20.BJP emerged as biggest gainer with victories in over 117 local bodies, cementing the position of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena secured 53 posts, while Ajit Pawar's NCP won 37.""We have won 117 presidents' posts, and more than 75% posts are with our Mahayuti partners. This is a repeat of the assembly election,"" Fadnavis said.CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “Compared to 2017, our elected representatives have doubled… This is the biggest win in local elections in the last 25 years for any party.”Final results of the 6,859 councillor seats were not released by the state election commission till the time of going to press. But BJP claimed to have won over 3,000 of these seats.Despite emerging as a distant challenger statewide, Congress checked BJP advances in parts of Vidarbha.Western Maharashtra saw Mahayuti allies battling each other as Congress and NCP (SP) struggled to hold ground. Meanwhile, BJP made gains in Mumbai and Konkan, encroaching into traditional Shiv Sena, PWP and NCP pockets. Shinde expanded Sena’s footprint beyond Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), finishing second across the state.North Maharashtra backed BJP strongly, especially in Jalgaon under minister Girish Mahajan. In Marathwada, expected gains from leaders such as Ashok Chavan and Munde cousins failed to materialise. Congress won just 28 civic bodies statewide. Sharad Pawar-led NCP managed seven, while Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena secured nine.Vidarbha delivered a fractured verdict. Congress halted BJP in several councils from Chandrapur to Buldhana and Ballarpur to Wardha, while BJP retained dominance in Nagpur, Gadchiroli and parts of Bhandara.Ajit Pawar-led NCP won 35 of 41 seats in Baramati region, the same undivided NCP had won in 2017. NCP (SP), led by Sharad Pawar, managed to win only one seat, while BSP and Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP) also won a seat each. Three seats went to Independent candidates while BJP failed to open its account.The outcome is seen as a curtain-raiser to municipal corporation polls due Jan 15 and comes amid anger over flood-hit kharif crops and opposition charges that funds were diverted to populist schemes such as Mukhyamantri Mazhi Ladki Bahin Yojana. Polls also marked first statewide civic exercise after Shiv Sena and NCP splits, consolidating Shinde and Ajit Pawar as undisputed leaders of their factions.Biggest beneficiary remains Fadnavis. After BJP’s poor 2024 Lok Sabha showing — nine of 48 seats — and his offer to resign, he led Mahayuti to an assembly landslide of over 230 seats, with BJP winning 132. Opposition allegations of “vote chori” and EVM manipulation resurfaced but lost traction after civic sweep.Analysts blamed MVA for failing to capitalise on farm distress. Former CM Prithviraj Chavan admitted Congress could not raise youth and farmer issues effectively.","Bjp emerged as biggest gainer with victories in over 117 local bodies.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday again addressed a press conference amid outrage over the ""new definition"" of the Aravali range, saying that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Speaking on the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of Aravalli, the minister said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He futher highlighted the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and international recognition of India’s forest cover, saying that under the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".Addressing concerns in some quarters over a possible expansion of mining activities in the Aravalli Hills and Ranges following the adoption of a uniform definition, Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was incorrect to conclude that mining would be permitted on all landforms below 100 metres in the Aravallis.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravalli can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravalli is protected and secure,” he posted on X.Yadav explained that the Aravali range comprises all landforms located within 500 metres of two adjoining hills with a height of 100 metres or more. All landforms falling within this 500-metre zone, regardless of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases, he said.The minister also elaborated on the issue while responding to a media query on the sidelines of a meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority at the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The query related to the Supreme Court of India’s recent acceptance of a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.Following the apex court’s acceptance that any landform located in the Aravali districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief would be classified as Aravali Hills, some stakeholders expressed apprehension that the move could open more than 90% of the Aravalis to mining, as most landforms lie below the 100-metre mark.","Bhupender yadav says ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the ncr"" supreme court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of aravalli endorses the government's efforts to protect the range.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126121988,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57824,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor at the centre of the recent hijab row after Bihar CM Nitish Kumar lifted her naqab during an event did not join duty on Saturday, officials confirmed to news agency PTI. They also reported no contact with her or the family members.Patna civil surgeon Avinash Kumar Singh confirmed that Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.“I have been informed that the last date of joining has been extended beyond December 20. It remains to be seen whether Parveen joins on Monday or not,” he said, without specifying the new deadline.The controversy erupted earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna. The video circulated widely on social media, capturing the moment Nitish Kumar questioned Parveen’s naqab when she came forward to receive her appointment letter along with other Ayush doctors.Also Read: Hijab row: SCBA issues 'strongest condemnation' over Nitish Kumar's act; seeks unconditional apology from Giriraj Singh, Sanjay Nishad Civil surgeon Singh said he was not aware of the reason for Parveen’s delay, as he “had no contact with her or the family members.”Vijay Kumar, a surgeon at Sabalpur PHC in Patna Sadar, where Parveen was supposed to join, also confirmed she had not reported for duty.“Around five-six people have joined today, and Parveen is not among them... Her name is in the list but we have not received her appointment letter from the civil surgeon office in Patna,” he said. As per protocol, candidates must first report to the civil surgeon’s office before joining their assigned workplace.Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammad Khan expressed disappointment over the controversy.“It pains me to hear the word ‘dispute’ in this case. Can there be any row between a father and a daughter?” he asked.“What have you people made out of it? This man (Nitish Kumar) considers female students as his daughters,” he added while speaking to reporters in Patna.Earlier, Mahfoozur Rahman, principal of Government Tibbi College & Hospital (GTCH), where Parveen is a second-year student, also suggested the joining deadline had been extended “in this special case”.“Ayush doctor Nusrat Parveen has not joined yet, and there is no update on her future course of action,” Rahman said.According to him, the family wants to avoid media attention. “Her family said that they want to escape media coverage, and that the woman doctor will rethink whether to join or not,” he said.Rahman also dismissed rumours that the family had shifted to Kolkata. “They have themselves rubbished such false news reports,” he said, quoting Parveen’s husband as saying the family is not upset with Nitish Kumar or the government.He added that “the family is disappointed with the row stirred by the media.”Rahman said Parveen last attended college on December 17 or 18 and noted that she still has the option to either join duty or pursue higher education.","Nusrat parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day’ closed.

‘Local-level confusion’: How Kharge’s remark adds twist to Siddaramaiah vs DK Shivakumar power tussle in Karnataka,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/local-level-confusion-how-kharges-remark-adds-twist-to-siddaramaiah-vs-dk-shivakumar-power-tussle-in-karnataka/articleshow/126124755.cms,"Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

NEW DELHI: Who will resolve the ongoing power tussle in Karnataka between chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar - top Congress leadership in Delhi or the leaders themselves at the local level?On Sunday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge shielded the ""high command"" from this embarrassing power game in Karnataka and said that “any confusion on the leadership issue existed at the local level.” Kharge also added that the local leaders should take ownership of the internal disputes rather than blaming the high command.The remark is not only interesting, given the strong and established high command culture in the grand-old party, but is also open to many interpretations.Did Kharge endorse Siddaramaiah’s claim to continue as chief minister for a full five-year term? After all, he is the chief minister at present and if there is no confusion at the central level on the leadership issue, it perhaps could mean that Siddaramaiah has the support of the high command.The talk about an alleged deal on rotational chief ministership and the demand for DK Shivakumar to take over the top post after two-and-a-half years has been raised by the supporters of the deputy chief minister at the local level. So, by calling the leadership tussle a local issue, is Kharge citing these claims in favour of DKS made by some MLAs and local Congress leaders?Kharge had, in his remarks, also cautioned party leaders against claiming credit for Congress's electoral success in the last assembly elections.""Everyone has built the party. It's not any individual's effort. Congress has been built by party workers. Congress workers supported us,"" Kharge said without naming anyone.This again points more towards the supporters of DK Shivakumar, who have openly claimed that the deputy chief minister, who is also the state Congress president, had played a key role in the party’s spectacular victory in the 2023 assembly elections.The Congress had in 2023 won a comprehensive majority, bagging 135 assembly seats out of 224 with a vote share of 43.2%. The BJP was decimated and reduced to just 66 seats with a vote share of 36.3%.However, the leadership tussle has overshadowed this victory from Day 1. The Congress leadership then had to make a lot of effort and persuasion to convince DK Shivakumar to allow Siddaramaiah to lead the government.There were then reports of an alleged power-sharing arrangement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar. As the Congress government crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, speculations intensified about a leadership change. MLAs of both factions have petitioned the high command in support of their leaders.Taking a cue from Kharge’s remark, Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara on Monday said any differences or confusions within the party over the leadership issue in the state have to be resolved locally.""Everyone of us should know, we should resolve ourselves. If the All India Congress president says that you (state leaders) resolve yourself and have nothing to do with the high command, we all have to sit together and resolve,"" Parameshwara said.Chief minister Siddaramaiah, however, reiterated his stand that Congress top leader Rahul Gandhi and the party high command will have to take a decision on the CM change issue, and everyone will abide by their decision.""I don't know about it. Rahul Gandhi and the high command have to decide. Whatever they decide, I'm committed to it,"" Siddaramaiah told reporters here in response to a question on Kharge's statement.""I have spoken to the high command. They have said that they will decide. I will abide by whatever the high command decides,"" he said.Siddaramaiah had on Friday asserted on the floor of the assembly that he would continue in office. He had also said that the Congress high command was ""in my favour"" and asserted that no decision was made on his staying at the helm for only two-and-a-half years.Reacting to his remarks, Shivakumar had said that he and CM Siddaramaiah have come to an agreement with the involvement of the Congress high command, and both of them will abide by it.This is not the first time that DKS has spoken about the power-sharing agreement. In fact, when the tussle had started, he had made a cryptic social media post stating that “word power is world power.”“Keeping one’s word is the greatest strength in the world! The biggest force in the world was to keep one’s word... Be it a judge, president, or anyone else, including myself, everyone has to walk the talk. Word power is world power,” DKS had then written.Siddramaraiah had then responded sharply to this and had countered DKS with his own play of words. ""A Word is not power unless it betters the World for the people,"" Siddaramaiah wrote and detailed the various welfare schemes that his government had launched for people of Karnataka.This power tussle has already caused a lot of embarrassment for the Congress leadership and also raised questions about its ability to resolve disputes between state leaders.Kharge’s remarks have done little to bring clarity on the way forward. It will be interesting to see how DKS responds to his statement, especially on not giving him credit for the party's victory in the 2023 elections.","Congress president mallikarjun kharge shielded the ""high command"" from this embarrassing power game in karnataka.

NEW DELHI: SC on Monday expressed concern over forest land being grabbed by private individuals in Uttarakhand and said it was shocking that the state govt remained a silent spectator over the years.While hearing an appeal on a litigation over a disputed parcel of forest land, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi expanded the case and decided to examine the alleged grabbing of 2,866 acres of land - notified as govt forest land - and allegedly leased out in 1950 to Rishikesh-based society Pashu Lok Seva Samiti, which subsequently allotted land parcels to its members.""The facts prima facie show as to how thousands of acres of forest land has been systematically grabbed by private individuals...What seems to be shocking to us is that the State of Uttarakhand and its authorities are sitting as silent spectators when the forest land is being systematically grabbed in front of their eyes. Consequently, we propose to enlarge the scope of these proceedings suo motu. Let notice be issued,"" it said.The bench ordered a probe into the case and sought a report from govt authorities. It directed all parties concerned to maintain status quo.It said land in dispute would not be sold or alienated, and no further construction would be carried out. It directed that no third party right will be created over the disputed land.""The chief secretary and principal chief conservator of forests are directed to constitute an enquiry committee to examine facts and submit a report to this court. Private individuals are restrained from alienating the land or creating third party rights. No construction shall be allowed. The vacant land, other than residential houses, shall be taken into possession by forest department and collector concerned,"" bench said.In this case, a large chunk of land - 2,866 acres - was leased out to Pashulok Seva Samiti in 1950 for allotting it to landless poor families of the area.

Murshidabad Tense as Humayun Kabir Faces Heat Over ‘Babri Masjid’ Foundation and Heavy Deployment

Political sparring over new outfit

Babri-style mosque move

NEW DELHI: West Bengal MLA Humayun Kabir on Monday launched his new political party, the Janata Unnayan Party, days after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) suspended him over his decision to lay the foundation stone for a Babri-style mosque in Murshidabad district.Speaking at a public meeting in Beldanga, Kabir said his party will contest the 2026 West Bengal assembly elections. He named eight candidates who will be fielded in the polls, though he did not say how many seats the party will contest in total. ""We can only tell you later how many seats we will be finally contesting,"" he told the gathering during the inauguration.Kabir, who is the MLA from Bharatpur, said he plans to contest from two assembly seats, Rejinagar and Beldanga, in Murshidabad.The ex-Trinamool leader further said he aimed to remove West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee from power in the upcoming assembly elections, which are due in less than six months. Kabir claimed that the chief minister has changed and is no longer accessible to ordinary people.""Mamata Banerjee is no longer the same person I knew. She is beyond the reach of the common man,"" he alleged, challenging her to win even a single seat.""I challenge Mamata Banerjee directly; show me that you can win a single seat.We will reduce Mamata Banerjee's party to zero in Murshidabad,"" Kabir claimed. ""I also want to warn the BJP. If they field candidates in 200 seats, I will show them by winning 100 seats,"" the JUP chief added.Earlier, the suspended MLA had asserted that he would emerge as a “kingmaker” in the 2026 West Bengal Assembly elections. He predicted that neither the ruling TMC nor the BJP would secure a simple majority, estimating that no party would cross the 148-seat mark in the 294-member Assembly.“I will be kingmaker after the elections. No one can form a government without my support,” Kabir said. He further claimed that his new party would contest 135 seats and win enough constituencies to play a decisive role in government formation. “Whoever goes to take oath as the chief minister will need the support of my party’s MLAs,” he added.While the TMC has not reacted directly, chief minister Mamata Banerjee accused the BJP of trying to drive a wedge among Muslims in Bengal while addressing a party meeting in Kolkata.Meanwhile, the BJP has dismissed Kabir’s move with state BJP president Samik Bhattacharya saying Kabir would not have any impact in the elections and accused him of working indirectly to help the TMC return to power.BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said, “Humayun Kabir is an agent of the TMC. Mamata Banerjee deliberately got Humayun Kabir to form a party to create polarisation, so that Muslim voters who are unhappy with Mamata do not shift to the opposition but instead move separately. This entire script has been written by Mamata Banerjee.""Kabir was suspended by the TMC on December 4 after his statement on building a Babri-style mosque sparked controversy. Two days later, on December 6, the anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 — Kabir went ahead and laid the foundation stone for the mosque at Rejinagar.Over the past decade, Kabir has been associated with several major political parties in West Bengal. He was expelled by the TMC in 2015 after criticising Mamata Banerjee and alleging that she was promoting her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee. He later contested the 2016 Assembly elections as an independent but lost. He then joined the Congress, before moving to the BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Kabir contested the Murshidabad Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket in 2019 but finished third. He later returned to the TMC and won the Bharatpur Assembly seat in 2021.","West bengal mla humayun kabir launches his new political party, the janata unnayan party.

"Electoral bonds scrapped by SC, trusts now swell BJP coffers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/electoral-bonds-scrapped-by-sc-trusts-now-swell-bjp-coffers/articleshow/126108961.cms,"Vaping, Bhow-Bhow & Shouting Match: A Look At Viral Moments Of Parl As Chaotic Winter Session Ends

NEW DELHI: Rather than having an adverse impact on BJP's coffers, scrapping of electoral bonds in Feb 2024 ended up boosting its donations kitty in 2024-25, with electoral trusts alone disbursing over Rs 3,577 crore to the party.In 2023-24, BJP's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at Rs 3,967 crore, of which Rs 1,686 crore came via bonds and Rs 856 crore through trusts. With electoral bonds scrapped, corporate donors still seeking partial anonymity - as regards party-wise break-up of their contributions - appear to have settled for the electoral trust (ET) route while retaining BJP as the top beneficiary.The party in office at the Centre cornered 83.6% of the nearly Rs 4,276 crore contributions routed through electorate trusts, according to data on the EC website. Compared to 2023-24, this marks an over four-fold rise in corporate donations to BJP through this route. Congress accounted for 7.3% and Trinamool Congress for 3.6% of contributions made through the ET route.The donations via electoral trusts are only a part of total contributions received by parties. The other sources include individuals, corporates, institutions and welfare bodies donating directly. Over the past years, the volume of non-trust donations has consistently exceeded that from contributions via trusts.Of the Rs 3,577.5 crore contribution receipts of BJP in 2024-25 though trusts, Rs 2,180.7 crore was disbursed by Prudent Electoral Trust (ET), Rs 757.6 crore by Progressive ET, Rs 460 crore by A B General ET, Rs 150 crore by New Democratic ET, Rs 30.1 crore by Harmony ET, Rs 21 crore by Triumph ET, Rs 5 crore by Jaybharath ET, Rs 3 crore by Samaj ET, Rs 9.5 lakh by Jankalyan ET and Rs 7.75 lakh by Einzigartig ET.Congress received Rs 216.3 crore from Prudent in 2024-25, Rs 77.3 crore from Progressive, Rs 15 crore from AB General ET, Rs 5 crore from New Democratic ET and Rs 9.5 lakh from Jan Kalyan ET. Thus, the grand old party received over Rs 313 crore of its total 517 crore contributions in 2024-25 via the trust route.Prudent maintained its position as the top trust donor to political parties, having disbursed a total of Rs 2,668 crore to 15 parties in the last financial year. The Tata Group-linked Progressive ET was a distant second with its total contributions at Rs 915 crore in 2024-25, of which Rs 757 crore went to BJP, Rs 77 crore to Congress and Rs 10 crore to eight other parties.Prudent's Rs 2,668 crore kitty was distributed among BJP (Rs 2,180.7 crore); Congress (Rs 216.3 crore); Trinamool Congress (Rs 92 crore); YSR Congress Party (Rs 88 crore); TDP (Rs 40 crore); AAP (Rs 16.4 crore); Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (Rs 10 crore); BRS, JDU, BJD and AJSU (Rs 5 crore each); Sikkim Democratic Front (Rs 2.5 crore); LJP and NCP (Rs 1 crore each); and Praja Shanthi Party (Rs 50 lakh).A B General ET made Rs 460 crore worth of corporate donations to BJP and Rs 15 crore to Congress. The Mahindra Group-backed New Democratic ET gave Rs 150 crore of its total Rs 160 crore contributions to BJP, with Congress and Shiv Sena-UBT receiving Rs 5 crore each. Triumph disbursed Rs 21 crore to BJP and Rs 4 crore to Telugu Desam Party. Harmony ET contributed Rs 30.1 crore to BJP, Rs 3 crore to Shiv Sena-UBT and Rs 2 crore to NCP-Sharad Pawar. Jan Pragati Electoral Trust disbursed Rs 1 crore to Shiv Sena.Congress's receipts in 2024-25 fell way short of the Rs 828 crore it had received via bonds in 2023-24 but were higher than its Rs 171 crore bond income in 2022-23, a non-general election year. Similarly, TMC's Rs 184.5 crore receipts in 2024-25, of which Rs 153.5 crore were through trusts, were no match for its Rs 612 crore receipts via bonds in 2023-24. BJD, which received Rs 245.5 crore in bonds in 2023-24, received Rs 60 crore in donations, including Rs 35 crore via trusts, in 2024-25. BRS not only saw its Rs 495 crore receipts in bonds (2023-24) eroded, but also its receipts from trusts, which dipped to Rs 15 crore from Rs 85 crore in 2023-24.","In 2023-24, bjp's total receipts through voluntary contributions had stood at rs 3,967 crore. With electoral bonds scrapped, corporate donors appear to have settled for the electoral trust (et) route. Prudent maintained its position as the top trust donor to political parties.

Bhupender Yadav on new Aravalli 'definition'

The road ahead

If demography can be a dividend, geography certainly decides its destiny. Few landscapes illustrate this more clearly than the Aravalli Range, an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern India.The hills that run for nearly 690 km from Gujarat through Rajasthan and Haryana to Delhi, forming the oldest fold mountain system in the subcontinent, have become the center of a long-running environmental and legal debate.At the heart of the issue is a simple but emotive question. What exactly counts as the Aravalli range? The answer matters because this classification determines which areas can be mined, built upon, or conserved.A recent ruling by the Supreme Court has accepted a ""standard definition"" proposed by the central government to identify what qualifies as the Aravalli Hills. While the move was intended to bring clarity to long-standing disputes, the definition’s limited ecological lens has raised fresh concerns about environmental protection and sustainable development.In November, the Supreme Court agreed with a proposal by the central government on how the Aravalli hills should be officially identified.The court said that only those hills that rise at least 100 metres above the surrounding land, or groups of such hills located close to each other, will be considered part of the Aravalli range for regulatory purposes.The court also asked the Union government to carefully map the region and prepare a clear plan for managing it. This plan will include rules on where mining can take place and how it should be regulated. The aim is to remove confusion caused by different government records and maps, which have often led to disputes and court cases in the past.Environmental experts maintain the significance of the Aravalli hills is not about how tall they are, but about what they do.The hills work like a natural water storage system, with their rocky structure allowing rainwater to slowly seep underground and refill aquifers. These aquifers supply water to many towns in Rajasthan and big cities such as Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, and Alwar. Studies even show that large-scale mining and cutting of hills damage this process, leading to long-term loss of groundwater.The Aravallis also help slow the spread of the Thar Desert towards eastern India. Scientists warn that if the hills continue to be damaged, desertification could increase, along with dust storms and extreme heat in the Indo-Gangetic plains.Although the region is dry, the Aravalli hills support forests, scrubland and grasslands. These habitats are home to wildlife such as leopards, hyenas, nilgai and many bird species. Conservationists say these ecosystems are fragile and can be easily broken apart by mining and construction.The current controversy is primarily rooted in decades of judicial scrutiny. Since the 1980s, courts have intervened repeatedly to curb unregulated mining in the Aravalli belt, particularly in Rajasthan and Haryana.Multiple Supreme Court orders in the 1990s and early 2000s restricted mining in notified forest areas, citing environmental degradation, air pollution and public health risks. However, enforcement remained weak due to the absence of a universally accepted definition of what constituted the Aravalli range.Mining operators and developers often argued that certain hillocks or plateaus did not legally qualify as Aravallis, even if they were ecologically linked to the system. This ambiguity reportedly created administrative paralysis and prolonged litigation, prompting the Centre to seek a standardised definition.Government officials and legal experts defending the Supreme Court’s ruling argue that the elevation-based criterion introduces clarity into a highly subjective domain. They say that by setting a measurable threshold, authorities can avoid arbitrary decisions and reduce disputes over land classification.In its observation, the top court acknowledged the need to balance environmental protection with economic realities. Mining of stone and minerals in the Aravalli region supports livelihoods and supplies essential materials for construction and infrastructure. A blanket ban, the SC noted, could have severe economic consequences if not backed by clear scientific and legal parameters.The ruling has drawn criticism from ecologists, hydrologists, and civil society groups who believe that the 100-meter threshold oversimplifies a complex landscape like the Aravalli.They point out that many ecologically critical features of the Aravalli system, including recharge zones, wildlife corridors and low-lying ridges, do not meet the elevation criterion but are vital to the range’s environmental function. Excluding these areas from automatic protection, critics say, could open the door to expanded mining and construction.Experts also warn that mining impacts are cumulative, as even shallow or small-scale extraction can permanently alter drainage patterns and soil stability, consequently reducing the land’s ability to absorb rainfall. In arid and semi-arid regions, such damage is often irreversible.Once this order is implemented in full force, which is for mining purposes, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha said, ""tomorrow it could be real estate or other things that could begin in the region, which is also the main fear of the locals of the entire region.""Disagreeing with the new definition of Aravalli, Jha said, ""the mountain is not just a piece of rock assembled together. Aravalli, which is the oldest mountain range in the world, is also an ecosystem."" He said, ""If mining is allowed...Aravalli, which is above the ground, is also under the ground. So it's not just the tree cover, green cover, or the national dust shield or weather shield it provides, but at the end of the day, temperature and air quality between Thar and Delhi are maintained because of the shield of the Aravalli. ""Shedding light on the risk arising from the new definition that ""lifts the protection,"" he said, risk is that all of this will be a large-scale plundering of this area and not just by mining, but also by other areas like real estate.""Once we start calling it a forest and not a range, and it falls under a semi-urban landscape or rural landscape rather than a protected landscape, it will be open for any kind of exploitation through economic-commercial activity,"" he told TOI.Talking about the impact on the Delhi-NCR region, which witnesses toxic-air-driven health hazards every year, Jha said, ""Firstly, desertification increases when we compromise with the buffer we have. Secondly, when the dust increases, the PM10 level we have in the Delhi-NCR is pathetic and therefore the risk or the intensity of air quality increases. Aravalli's entire area is also the main water recharge table, so the water sufficiency of the region is also questioned because of mining. ""Magasaysay awardee Rajendra Singh, known as the ""Waterman of India,"" said earlier governments and courts took nature and environmental issues seriously, but that approach has disappeared.""If this decision, meant to benefit one individual, is implemented, only 7-8 per cent of the Aravalli will survive,"" he told news agency PTI, calling for a legal battle as well as mass public mobilisation.Amid concerns in some quarters over a possible expansion of mining activities in the Aravalli Hills and Ranges following the adoption of a uniform definition, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was incorrect to conclude that mining would be permitted on all landforms below 100 metres in the Aravallis.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravalli can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravalli is protected and secure,” he posted on X.Yadav explained that the Aravali range comprises all landforms located within 500 metres of two adjoining hills with a height of 100 metres or more. All landforms falling within this 500-metre zone, regardless of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases, he said.The minister also elaborated on the issue while responding to a media query on the sidelines of a meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority at the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The query related to the Supreme Court of India’s recent acceptance of a uniform, policy-level definition of the Aravali Hills and Ranges, particularly with respect to regulating mining.Following the apex court’s acceptance that any landform located in the Aravali districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief would be classified as Aravali Hills, some stakeholders expressed apprehension that the move could open more than 90% of the Aravalis to mining, as most landforms lie below the 100-metre mark.Yadav, however, stressed that all landforms enclosed within the lowest binding contour encircling hills of 100 metres or more, irrespective of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases.The Supreme Court’s directive to conduct scientific mapping is now seen as the critical next step. Environmental lawyers say the outcome will depend on how comprehensively the mapping exercise incorporates hydrology, biodiversity and geomorphology, rather than focusing solely on elevation. Transparency will also be key.Civil society groups have demanded that maps and management plans be made public and subjected to independent scientific review. Without such safeguards, they argue, the process risks becoming a procedural formality rather than a tool for genuine conservation.At its core, the Aravalli debate reflects a broader challenge in India’s environmental governance. How to reconcile development pressures with the protection of natural systems that do not conform neatly to administrative boundaries or numerical thresholds.As climate stress intensifies and water scarcity deepens across north-west India, the fate of the Aravalli range carries implications far beyond the hills themselves. Whether the Supreme Court’s attempt at regulatory clarity strengthens or weakens environmental protection will depend on how the ruling is implemented on the ground, which ultimately remains at the mercy of bureaucracy.For now, India’s oldest mountain range stands at a crossroads, its fate being debated and defined by modern institutions that are only a moment in time compared to the ancient geology they now seek to regulate.","Aravalli range is an ancient chain of hills that quietly shapes water security, climate, and life across western and northwestern india. The hills that run for nearly 690 km from gujarat through rajasthan and haryana to delhi have become the center of a long-running environmental and legal debate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126103486,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-102416,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
G RAM G: BJP accuses Omar Abdullah of mocking faith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/g-ram-g-bjp-accuses-omar-abdullah-of-mocking-faith/articleshow/126127289.cms,"SRINAGAR: Two days after J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah said the name of the new rural employment guarantee scheme, G RAM G, reminded him of Bollywood film ‘Ji Mummy Ji’, BJP on Monday accused him of ridiculing people’s faith.At a press briefing, BJP spokesperson Abhijeet Jasrotia said the CM should have refrained from commenting on the name. Describing it as a matter of faith, Jasrotia said, “The chief minister should not make jokes about the name. We strongly object to this and will not tolerate it.” Omar held a constitutional post and must exercise restraint while talking on issues linked to faith, he added.Omar had on Saturday questioned the Centre’s move to replace MGNREGA with Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin), or VB-G RAM G, and had also expressed surprise over the nomenclature. “First of all, I am surprised where this name came from,” he said. “Who names a bill as G RAM G?” He also criticised the dropping of Mahatma Gandhi ’s name from the employment scheme.Jasrotia said Omar’s family has had longstanding associations with religious and cultural traditions linked to Lord Ram, and it was unfortunate the CM had forgotten these. His father Farooq Abdullah publicly sang bhajans dedicated to Lord Ram, and the chief minister should respect such tradition in his own family, the spokesperson added.Defending the re-naming, BJP said welfare schemes ensuring dignity of labour and livelihood security were in keeping with Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals. “Gandhiji stood for empowering the weakest sections. Any initiative that guarantees work and food security reflects that vision. If in Gandhi’s time the scheme would be renamed as such, he would have been happy about it,” Jasrotia said.","J&k chief minister omar abdullah said the name of the new rural employment guarantee scheme, g ram g, reminded him of bollywood film ‘ji mummy ji’ bjp on monday accused him of ridiculing people’s faith.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126127292,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-392704,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
