NEW DELHI: What if spotting a cluster of fevers or sudden diarrhoea cases in your neighbourhood could help stop an outbreak? A new nationwide system launched by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is now making that possible — by turning ordinary citizens into the country’s earliest disease sentinels.At the heart of the system is a simple QR code. Anyone can scan it from the Health Ministry or NCDC website, or from posters and materials being rolled out across states. Once scanned, the user enters basic details and selects what they’re reporting — a fever cluster, recurring diarrhoea, jaundice, dog bites, suspected food poisoning or any other unusual health event. Photos or short videos can also be uploaded. The moment a report is submitted, the alert lands simultaneously in district, state and national surveillance dashboards, where officers verify it and initiate investigations if required.Dr Ranjan Das, director NCDC said that the tool fills a critical gap in India’s surveillance network. Many outbreaks begin silently in homes, neighbourhoods or small gatherings well before patients reach hospitals. A citizen report — sometimes within hours — can help health authorities intervene early, contain spread and prevent large-scale outbreaks.Dr Himanshu Chauhan, additional director and HOD IDSP call this a “game changer,” especially during dengue, diarrhoea, influenza and waterborne disease seasons.But they caution that the system will work only if citizens use it responsibly — and consistently.To protect users, all submissions are routed through secure government servers, with personal data safeguarded under national cyber-security protocols. False or irrelevant reports are filtered through a combination of automated checks and manual verification by trained district teams.The Community Reporting System, introduced in January 2024 under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), was envisioned to give communities a direct role in early outbreak detection. Despite being launched in 2024, the tool remained largely unknown due to poor efforts to popularize it, resulting in only about 100 valid reports so far. The low utilisation highlights the gap between technology and public engagement, though officials say even this early trickle shows that once people know the platform exists, they are willing to report.The message from NCDC is clear: public health isn’t just a government job — it needs citizen vigilance too. Sometimes, a QR scan and 30 seconds may be all it takes to stop the next outbreak.","A new nationwide system launched by the national centre for disease control (ncdc) is now making that possible.

NEW DELHI: India’s HIV epidemic continues to decline, with adult HIV prevalence steady at 0.2% and AIDS-related deaths dropping 81% since 2010 — one of the steepest reductions globally.New HIV infections have fallen by nearly 49%, placing India ahead of worldwide trends.But this national success hides a troubling shift. The latest HIV burden estimate shows sharp surges in the Northeast, with Mizoram and Nagaland now recording HIV prevalence of above 1% — more than five times the national average.Several other states — such as Meghalaya and Punjab — are also reporting spikes linked to drug use and changing sexual behaviour among young adults.The findings come from the India HIV Estimation 2025, released by Union health minister Jagat Prakash Nadda at the national World AIDS Day event at Vigyan Bhawan on Monday.Developed by NACO under the IESE framework, the report covers 34 States/UTs and 762 districts and was led by ICMR–NIRDHDS with support from nine national institutes and state AIDS control societies.Releasing the report, Nadda said India’s HIV programme continues to show strong gains, with testing rising from 4.1 crore to 6.6 crore, people on treatment increasing from 14.9 lakh to 18.6 lakh and viral load tests nearly doubling to 16 lakh.India has achieved a 35% drop in new HIV infections and a 69% decline in HIV-related deaths, outperforming global averages.He added that 85% of people with HIV know their status, 88% are on treatment and 97% have viral suppression — putting the country firmly on track to meet the 95-95-95 targets by 2030. Nadda, however, cautioned that HIV–TB co-infection and poor adherence to ART remain major hurdles that demand intensified counselling and community support.Nationally, India was estimated to have 25.6 lakh people living with HIV in 2024, including nearly 14 lakh men and 11 lakh women. HIV prevalence among youth (15–24 years) remains low at 0.06%.Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka continue to carry the largest burdens and, together with six other states, account for 74% of all PLHIV in the country. The Northeast, however, presents the sharpest warning signs. Mizoram’s new infection rate (0.9 per 1,000 uninfected population) is nearly 18 times the national average.","India has achieved a 35% drop in new hiv infections and a 69% decline in hiv-related deaths.

Supreme Court Stays Key Provisions Of Waqf Amendment Act, Refuses To Suspend Other Proposals

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday refused to extend time for the mandatory registration of all waqf properties on the UMEED portal and asked those who have not done so to approach the tribunal constituted under Waqf (Amendment) Act, which has the power to extend the period by six months.Running against time to comply with registration as the deadline is to expire on Dec 6, a batch of petitions were filed in the apex court, including by All India Muslim Personal Law Board, for extension of time on various grounds including because of technical glitches encountered in accessing the portal. But the Centre strongly opposed the plea saying the Act states the extension can be granted by the waqf tribunal and aggrieved persons should approach it.Appearing before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and M R Samshad said that so far, only around 1.6 lakh properties had been uploaded, and while the total number of such assets might be above 10 lakh, it would be difficult to upload details within the short span of time.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, however, said the court’s interference to extend the date would amount to amending the law itself which provided six months time.He also told SC the issue can be examined by the tribunal.Section 3B of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 says every waqf registered under this Act shall file the details of the waqf and the property dedicated to the waqf on the portal and database, within a period of six months from such commencement. It, however, provides that the tribunal may, on an application made to it by the mutawalli, extend such period of six months under this section for a further period not exceeding six months as it may consider appropriate, if he satisfies the tribunal that he had sufficient cause for not filing the details of the waqf on the portal within such period.Taking note that the issue could be examined by the tribunal, the bench refused to extend the time. SC said that facing technical problems in uploading details of the properties would be a valid ground to seek a further six months time from the tribunal. “Technical glitch is a very good reason to seek extension from tribunal,” the bench said.The court had in Sept declined to stay many of the provisions under challenge in a batch of petitions challenging the amendments, including the requirement for all waqfs to be registered under section 3B, considering such a registration requirement was there earlier as well.","Supreme court on monday refused to extend time for mandatory registration of all waqf properties on the umeed portal.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has submitted its affidavit over the ongoing special intensive revision of electoral rolls in several states, refuting allegations of mass deletion of genuine voters as “highly exaggerated, speculative and politically motivated. ”In an 81-page counter-affidavit filed on November 26 in a petition by TMC MP Dola Sen and others, the poll panel said the narrative alleging widespread disenfranchisement in West Bengal was being “amplified to serve vested political interests.”In the affidavit, Pawan Diwan, the secretary of the Election Commission, sought dismissal of the petitions filed against the poll panel’s decisions to conduct SIR.“That it is submitted, that a harmonious reading of Articles 324 and 326 read with Sections 16, 19, and 22 of the RP Act 1950, read with Rule 21A, makes it clear that the ECI is vested with powers to assess the eligibility of the electors including citizenship for enabling the constitutional right to vote,” it said.“The guidelines issued with respect to the SIR exercise are constitutional and in the interest of maintaining the purity of electoral rolls, which is a pre-requisite for free and fair elections that form a basic feature of the Constitution,” it added.The poll panel also said its powers to undertake such revisions are firmly grounded in Articles 324 and 326 of the Constitution, and in various provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, and the Registration of Electors Rules.In its affidavit, the poll panel said, “Under Article 324 of the Constitution, the superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections to Parliament and to the Legislature of every state are vested in the Election Commission of India.”The EC stressed that the preparation and revision of electoral rolls is a “cooperative and participatory exercise”, and that only those electors who cannot trace their eligibility to the last nationwide SIR conducted in 2002 are required to sign enumeration forms and later submit documents if asked.The affidavit emphasised that eligibility under Article 326 — citizenship, age, residency and absence of disqualification — is presumed unless contrary inputs are received. Therefore, allegations of arbitrary classification or violation of Article 14 were “misconceived”, it said.“That the SIR exercise adds to the purity of elections by weeding out ineligible persons from the electoral roll. The entitlement to vote flows from Article 326 read with Sections 16 and 19 of the RP Act 1950 and Section 62 of the RP Act 1951...,” it said.This comes after a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi sought separate responses from the poll panel on the pleas filed by the DMK, CPI(M), the West Bengal unit of the Congress and Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, challenging the SIR exercise in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal respectively.The pan-India SIR was launched through an order dated June 24, beginning with Bihar. Phase II, covering 12 states including Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, commenced after a follow-up order on October 27, it added.“This Court would be loath to countenance the highly speculative and exaggerated contentions of the petitioner in the present writ petition as regards possibility of mass disenfranchisement and improper implementation of SIR in the State of Tamil Nadu,” it said.It said the ECI is cognizant of its responsibility towards the electors, and all possible efforts are being made to ensure the SIR exercise is implemented successfully and no eligible elector is left out of the electoral rolls.Dismissing these concerns, the EC said the claims were “highly speculative and exaggerated.”","The election commission refutes allegations of mass deletion of genuine voters.

NEW DELHI: The issue of Special Intensive Revision (SIR) triggered the expected uproar as the winter session of Parliament opened on Monday, setting the stage for the electoral roll revision debate to dominate proceedings in the days ahead.The winter session is scheduled to conclude on December 19.At the all-party meeting on Sunday, Opposition parties signalled they would raise the SIR issue forcefully during the session and warned that the government would be responsible for any resulting washout or disruptions.Here's who said what on SIR:""Opposition demand for discussion on SIR is under govt's consideration. It is not rejected. The govt is not averse to take up discussion on anything, including SIR, electoral reforms; give some time to respond. Do not put a condition on timeline for discussion on SIR, electoral reforms.""""""Over a singular issue of SIR, the opposition will wash out an entire session of the Parliament. Such things affect first-time MPs, who really want to work for their constituencies and want to raise issues on the floor of the house.The Prime Minister's concern is legitimate because we have just these 5 years to work for my people and country.""""The last session was also washed out over the issue of SIR. At that time, SIR was underway in Bihar... The Election Commission had asked all parties to file their complaints in case there are any discrepancies in the process, but not one party filed any complaint.""If they (opposition) create a ruckus in the House and gather in the well, then they don't want a discussion on the SIR, they want to stall proceedings. What discussion do they want on the SIR? People of Bihar have given their mandate and answer on their SIR issues.""""Election situation, SIR, and pollution are huge issues. Let us discuss them. What is the Parliament for? It's not drama. Speaking about and raising issues is not drama. Drama is not allowing democratic discussions about issues that matter to the public.""""Opposition will stand by their principles. There are key issues such as SIR and the terrorist attack in Delhi, which the opposition will consistently raise... We will also address the non-payment of dues to states.""""What opposition is asking is a debate on SIR. Is it drama? If raising people’s voices is drama, then people will give them a reply in the next election. 40 people, including BLOs, died. They have blamed ECI. Where is accountability from the government? We are not against SIR, but we are against the method and way it is being executed.""""The worry over SIR is becoming real today. If a vote is cut, then how will a person fulfill his/her dream...This ongoing SIR is not for strengthening democracy but cutting votes. On the ground, the BLOs are not even able to fill out forms; many of them are under stress...Why this hurry, when there is no election in UP immediately?""""The opposition wants a discussion about the SIR, about the electoral process of the country, and protecting the democracy.

‘Is There Any Law?’ Renuka Chaudhary Sparks Row After Bringing Stray Dog to Parliament

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Renuka Chaudhary stirred a row after she brought a stray dog to Parliament grounds on the first day of the Winter Session, disregarding protests from fellow MPs, while asserting that the ""real dogs are sitting in Parliament"" who regularly bite people.However Chaudhary claimed that she discovered the puppy en route to Parliament that morning. After witnessing a collision between a scooter and car, she noticed the puppy near the roadside. Concerned for its safety, she transported it in her vehicle. The animal remained within the car and departed when the vehicle left after dropping her off.""Is there any law? I was on my way. A scooter collided with a car. This little puppy was wandering on the road. I thought it would get hit by the wheel. So I picked it up, put it in the car, came to Parliament, and sent it back. The car left, and so did the dog. So what's the point of this discussion?"" Chaudhary explained to ANI.Further justifying herself and taking jab at the government she added that the ""real dogs are sitting in Parliament.""""The real ones who bite are sitting in Parliament. They run the government. We take care of a mute animal, and this has become a big issue and a topic of discussion.Does the government have nothing else to do? I sent the dog home and told them to keep it at home... We don't talk about those who sit in Parliament and bite us every day,"" she said.However, BJP MP Jagdambika Pal criticised Chowdhury, accusing her of creating a “tamasha” (theatrics) and breaching protocol by bringing a dog into Parliament. He argued that members are not permitted to bring anyone inside the premises without proper documentation and urged that action be taken against the Congress MP.“You are not serious about debating issues... you are making a joke of Parliament with such tamasha... She is a member of the House and should raise issues of public importance instead of indulging in such drama,” Pal said.“She should be taken to task by the Chairman of the House,” he added, calling for strict action.The BJP MP further maintained that dogs or any animals cannot be brought into the Parliament premises.Concurrently, the winter session, particularly in Lok Sabha, experienced continuous protests and slogan-shouting by Opposition MPs requesting discussions about the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) nationwide. As Opposition members chanted ""vote chor, gaddi chod"", MP Sandhya Rai, presiding from the Speaker's position, suspended proceedings until 2 PM.Additionally, the Rajya Sabha suspended activities until 2 PM, following discussions regarding felicitations for the new Rajya Sabha chairman and Vice President, CP Radhakrishan, who commenced his duties in September.The proceedings included Rajya Sabha MPs from various political affiliations welcoming Vice President Radhakrishnan to the chamber.","Congress mp renuka chaudhary stirred a row after she brought a stray dog to parliament grounds on the first day of the winter session.

NEW DELHI: As a Rs 50,000-crore sword hangs over air travellers at Delhi and Mumbai airports, the Centre has decided to back passengers in an old legal battle between airport operators and the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA), which has now reachedSupreme Court, where the matter will be heard on Dec 3.The case relates to ""hypothetical regulatory asset base (HRAB)"", the capital value of the assets used to calculate the costs of the regulated services, for the first two years of these airports during the PPP era, which started about 20 years ago.After a protracted legal battle followed by the recent Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) judgment, the case has now reached SC, where the two operators of the Delhi and Mumbai airports, DIAL and MIAL, have challenged the tribunal's order striking down theirRs 50,000-crore HRAB claim.""Aviation ministry is going to back AERA in this case as the implications of fares on air travellers are immense. If the private operators of Delhi and Mumbai airports win the case, we are looking at about Rs 50,000 crore getting due to these two operators, which could mean a manifold hike in both user development fees (UDF) paid directly by passengers, and airline landing and parking charges that air carriers factor in while calculating airfares.Overall, the burden for passengers could increase majorly. So, govt has decided to back AERA completely,"" officials said, adding UDF alone could rise by about nine times in Delhi and 21 times in Mumbai.Civil aviation ministry estimates domestic UDF at Delhi could rise from Rs 129 by almost 10 times to Rs 1,261, and at Mumbai from Rs 175 by 22 times to Rs 3,856.In early 2006, Delhi and Mumbai airports were handed over to private players for being developed in PPP (public private partnership) mode. Until then, the state-run Airports Authority of India used to have common charges for all its airports.AERA, which determines tariffs for major airports, came into being in mid-2009. ""The dispute essentially is for the period between the airports being handed over to GMR Group in Delhi and the then GVK Group in Mumbai, and the time when AERA started deciding aeronautical tariffs. If this amount of Rs 50,000 crore becomes due to the developers, the same will be recovered through passengers paying more, and this has to be fought tooth and nail legally. Aviation ministry will do just that,"" said sources.""DIAL and MIAL want a much higher value of assets they got in 2006. What were the assets that time at the two ariports? Run-down terminals barely worth a few hundred crores. They want value of non-aero assets to be added in the regulatory asset base. If that happens and value of non-aero development like hotels, malls and other commercial development is added, the entire model of brownfield airport development will go for a toss as it will come too expensive for users,"" officials said.","Operators dial and mial have challenged a tdsat verdict striking down their hypothetical regulatory asset base (hrab) claim.

I am willing to give them tips as to how they should perform,” he told the media at Parliament complex before the two Houses assembled for winter session.In a sharp takedown of opposition, which has conveyed its intention to disrupt parliamentary proceedings if govt does not agree to its demand for a discussion on SIR, PM Narendra Modi in his customary remarks before winter session began said some parties are using Parliament for “warming up” before polls and as an extension of their state politics.As opposition insists on a debate on SIR, Modi hit back saying he thought these parties would get their act together in the period since Bihar poll result but the defeat continues to trouble them. Similar protests from Congress, Left and regional parties had all but washed out the last session. “Parliament should be a forum for discussing policies and not raising slogans,” he said. These parties can raise slogans anywhere in the country as they did where they were defeated, and they can do where they are going to be defeated, he added.This winter session, he said in a message to the governing NDA members, should also not be a show of arrogance over the alliance’s victory. Modi’s jibe was as much aimed at Congress — whose member Rahul Gandhi led a yatra against SIR in Bihar before polls and framed his campaign around the charge of ‘vote chori’ — and regional parties like TMC, DMK and SP.While TMC-governed Bengal and DMK-governed TN are going to assembly polls in the first half of 2026, elections will be held in UP (where SP is principal challenger to BJP) early 2027. CPM-governed Kerala is also among poll-bound states. All these parties are united in demanding a discussion over the ongoing SIR of electoral rolls in 12 states and UTs.Turning up the heat on rivals, Modi, said, “I have seen that there is so much anti-incumbency against the parties in office in some states that they are unable to face the masses there. They are venting their anger in Parliament.” “Negativity,” he emphasised, “may help to some extent in politics but opposition should also contribute positively to nation-building and raise strong issues.”Citing high voter turnout in Bihar polls coupled with the country’s robust economic growth, he said India has shown the world that democracy can deliver. Modi lamented that first-time MPs are especially sad that they are unable to raise their issues and show their performance due to repeated and long disruptions in Parliament. He expressed hope that this session will not be seen as merely a ritual but energise efforts toward progress.","Pm narendra modi asks the opposition not to turn parliament into a platform for venting its frustration over the crushing defeat in bihar. “parliament should be a forum for discussing policies and not raising slogans,” he said.

Measures must be implemented round the year, says apex court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday bristled at attempts to pin the blame for Delhi-NCR air pollution on farm fires and asked the Union and NCR govts to detail measures taken on other pollution sources — vehicles, industries, construction, dust — and the tangible results achieved through implementation of such steps.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Aparajita Singh and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said stubble burning incidents contribute to pollution in Delhi-NCR for just 15 days in winter months, but there are other major causes of pollution which need to be addressed round the year.In defence of farmers, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “Let stubble burning not be made a political or ego issue. During Covid (lockdown), stubble burning was there. Yet, we could see stars in the night sky. You (govt) say measures have been taken. Still, we can’t see stars. What are the tangible results achieved through enforcement of graded action plan (Grap)? What actions have been taken against other sources of pollution?”What is being done about high-end gas guzzlers, the bench asked. “Strengthening quality public transport is key to reducing vehicular contribution towards air pollution. But that will take time and should be part of the long-term plan,” it said, adding that financial empowerment of people in India has led to a burgeoning number of cars in the capital city, which was not planned to accommodate so many people with individual vehicles.As Bhati informed the court that the number of incidents of stubble burning has gradually gone down in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, the bench asked if there has been corresponding improvement in air quality in Delhi-NCR. “Normatively, you might have banned construction activities but is there sincere implementation on the ground?”Bhati admitted that Grap restrictions have not been scrupulously enforced.The bench said that both short-term and long-term measures require intensive implementation round the year and promised that matters relating to air pollution would be heard by SC at least twice a month round the year.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar said all thermal power plants were required to implement sulphur dioxide emission control measures, primarily by installing the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system, by 2021.The deadline has been extended by the govt several times, and now the thermal power plants have been asked to implement the emission control measure by 2027-29, he said.When Bhati said that the govt has already filed both short-term and long-term plans to tackle the problem of air pollution, the bench asked why they are not been revisited if they have not been able to reduce pollution.On many occasions, the rural-urban bias of experts results in misdirection of efforts to curb pollution, it said, and suggested that experts aware of ground realities of India, not those who studied at Harvard or other foreign universities, prepare action plans.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Dec 10.",Supreme court bristled at attempts to pin the blame for delhi-ncr air pollution on farm fires.

Can give life convict bail during pendency of appeal if he has a fair chance of acquittal: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-give-life-convict-bail-during-pendency-of-appeal-if-he-has-a-fair-chance-of-acquittal-sc/articleshow/125706804.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking a liberal approach in granting relief to convicts, Supreme Court has held that even a life convict can be released on bail during pendency of his appeal if he has a fair chance of getting acquitted in a higher court.Applying this principle, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan suspended the sentence of life imprisonment of a Tamil Nadu police officer who was convicted and sentenced in a custodial death case which allegedly took place in 1999 in Thoothukudi police station. The court granted relief after senior advocate MukulRohatgi and lawyer Anand Verma pointed out the contradiction in oral evidence of prosecution witnesses (PW).""When the court is called upon to consider the plea for suspension of a substantive order of life imprisonment, the considerations are different. In cases of fixed sentence, the appellate court may consider the plea liberally unless there are exceptional circumstances to deny suspension. When it comes to life imprisonment, the appellate court should consider whether there is anything palpable or anything on the face of the record on the basis of which it could be said that the appellant has fair chances of succeeding in his appeal and getting acquitted,"" the bench said.The court said prima facie, it is of the view that the oral evidence of the PW 4 and the PW 5 respectively is in direct conflict on material aspects with the evidence of the PW 2.""The law is well settled. Conviction can be based on the evidence of a solitary eye-witness provided it is found to be wholly reliable. If it is found to be wholly unreliable, then there is no problem in discarding the entire evidence. There could be a third category wherein the court may find the evidence of a solitary eye-witness is neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable and in such a situation, the court must insist for corroboration in material particulars. We tried exactly to do the same thing by cursorily looking into the evidence of the PW 4 and PW 5 respectively. Prima facie, the oral evidence does not inspire confidence. In such circumstances referred to above, we are persuaded to accept the plea of the appellant for suspension of the substantive order of sentence pending the final disposal of his criminal appeal before high court,"" the bench said.",Justices j b pardiwala and k v viswanathan suspended the sentence of a tamil nadu police officer.

NEW DELHI: Vice President C P Radhakrishnan’s first day as chairman of Rajya Sabha was marked by a warm welcome by treasury benches led by PM Narendra Modi and clashes between them and opposition as the latter raised the issue of ex-VP Jagdeep Dhankhar.PM praised Radhakrishnan’s contributions and said his rise from an ordinary background to the office of vice president reflects the true strength of democracy. The PM assured him that the Upper House will always uphold the dignity of the “esteemed institution and will remain ever mindful of maintaining your dignity as well”.Welcoming the new chairman, PM Modi recalled his past association with Radhakrishnan and said that he has always set himself apart by rising above the constraints of protocol. “In public life, there is a special strength in living beyond protocol, and we have always seen that strength in you.”But a clash between BJP and Congress members erupted as leader of opposition in RS Mallikarjun Kharge recalled the sudden resignation of former VP Jagdeep Dhankhar. Kharge said any democracy in which opposition is not allowed to criticise freely govt policies will degenerate into tyranny.Kharge assured the chairman of Congress’ support, but urged him to treat opposition and treasury equally.“Fair and impartial conduct of proceedings, providing just opportunity to members of each party, is essential for credibility of this office,” he said.He referred to Dhankhar, who had resigned from the post of VP on July 21 over “health” issues. “I am constrained to refer to your predecessor’s completely unexpected and sudden exit from the office of the chairman, RS. The chairman, being custodian of the entire House, belongs as much to opposition as to govt. I was disheartened that the House did not get an opportunity to bid him a farewell. Regardless, wish him, on behalf of the entire opposition, a very healthy life,” he said.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju slammed Kharge: “I just want to remind the House that you have forgotten the language you used to insult him... The removal motion you served, a copy of which we still have...just think how much you have tarnished the dignity of the chair. My appeal is, please do not refer to anything which is not necessary on this solemn occasion.”Leader of the House in RS J P Nadda also criticised Kharge. Nadda said Radhakrishnan’s public life was unblemished. He ended his speech by quoting former President S Radhakrishnan: “We should behave like responsible members in Parliament and not as professional agitators.”Earlier, members appealed to the chairman to ensure that opposition gets a voice in Parliament. “This is the only forum where opposition can put its point across,” said Congress MP Rajiv Shukla.

NEW DELHI: Accusing PM Narendra Modi of “delivering dramabazi” on the first day of winter session of Parliament, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said BJP govt has shattered parliamentary conventions over the past 11 years by refusing to debate issues of public concern and by bulldozing bills detrimental to the common man, like the farm laws. Opposition will continue to demand a discussion on ‘vote chori’ in the wake of deaths of BLOs, he stressed.Kharge said govt passed 12 bills without discussion in less than 15 minutes during Monsoon session, while the PM had remained completely silent on the Manipur turmoil till opposition was forced to move a no-confidence motion on the issue.“BJP should now end this drama of distraction and engage in debate on real issues facing the people. The truth is that the common man is struggling with unemployment, inflation, economic inequality and looting of the country’s precious resources, while those in power are playing the game of dramabazi in arrogance of authority,” he said.Slamming Modi’s hurling of “drama” jibe at opposition, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav asked if the death of BLOs is a “drama” too and if police-BJP nexus in UP polls which saw “cops flashing revolvers” to stop voters from voting was also a “drama”.Akhilesh demanded that EC pay Rs 1 crore compensation to families of BLOs who have died because of the stressful SIR exercise.Demanding a discussion in Parliament on SIR, he said, “There is chaos. BLOs were not properly trained to enrol voters. It is EC’s job to enrol voters, but here political parties are running around to ensure that voting rights are safeguarded.”He alleged, “SIR is being done to help BJP win after they lost (LS) elections. Big IT companies are helping BJP weed out voters and identify who should be included. In UP and Bengal, we can clearly see that BJP wants to oust voters at the booths where opposition parties won in (LS) elections.”","Mallikarjun kharge accuses pm narendra modi of ‘delivering dramabazi’ on the first day of winter session of parliament.

PM Modi’s ‘Drama Nahi, Delivery’ Message Sets Fiery Tone As Winter Session Begins Amid Tensions

NEW DELHI: Eight states and a Union territory have changed the name of their governor/lieutenant governor’s house from ‘Raj Bhavan/Raj Niwas’ to ‘Lok Bhavan/Lok Niwas’ following a directive from ministry of home affairs (MHA) to shed the earlier nomenclature associated with colonial era.In a letter to principal secretaries or secretaries to state governors and lieutenant governors of UTs, the home ministry cited the suggestion made at the conference of governors held last year “to rename ‘Raj Bhavans’ as ‘Lok Bhavans’ as the word ‘Raj Bhavan’ smacks of colonialism.”“Accordingly, it is requested that offices of governor and office of Lt governor may be named as ‘Lok Bhavan’ and ‘Lok Niwas’, respectively, for all official purposes,” said the MHA directive.Taking cue from the MHA letter, states/UTs have started shedding the word ‘Raj’ from the nomenclature of governor/lieutenant governor’s residence-cum-office.West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Gujarat and Tripura have effected the change and renamed ‘Raj Bhavan’ as ‘Lok Bhavan’. Ladakh’s Raj Niwas, the official residence and office of LG Kavinder Gupta, has been renamed as ‘Lok Niwas’.The Modi govt has been working on shedding the vestiges of India’s colonial past; it had earlier renamed Rajpath as Kartavya Path and has been using ‘Bharat’ instead of ‘India’ in many official communications. Govt websites now first show content in Hindi, though there is an option to view it in English.

NEW DELHI: SC on Monday sought the Centre’s response to a suggestion for allowing Sonali, a pregnant woman who was deported to Bangladesh for allegedly being a citizen of the neighbouring country, and her 5-year-old son to return to India and getting her admitted to hospital.Responding to a plea by Sanjay Hegde, counsel for Sonali’s father, that the woman needs to be home because of her advanced pregnancy, a bench led by CJI Surya Kant asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta whether she could be allowed to come back with her minor son. They are presently detained at Chapainawabganj in Bangladesh.Hegde said the place of detention is just 40 km from Indo-Bangladesh border and that she and her son could come to the nearby border checkpoint for entry into West Bengal.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court order for pan-India CBI probe into 'digital arrest' cases, while signifying the threat from digital scamsters, is important also because the opposition-governed states had withdrawn ""general consent"" to CBI to probe crimes in their territories.Keeping two other forms of cyber-crime - investment scams and part-time job scams - on the back burner, the bench said CBI shall investigate digital arrest scam cases, and the court will consider whether the other two forms of cyber-crime require court supervision/monitoring. Suspecting assistance to scamsters by banking system insiders, the bench said, ""CBI shall have a free hand to investigate bankers under Prevention of Corruption Act when they are suspected to be involved in the opening of 'mule accounts' where the fraudsters park their extorted monies. ""CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi said that given the magnitude of the crimes and the fact that many of them were being committed from 'scam hubs' located in foreign countries, ""we direct the CBI to coordinate with Interpol to lay their hands on the cyber-crime havens operating from abroad"".The bench also issued notice to RBI and asked it to explain to the court why artificial intelligence tools or machine-learning technologies should not be employed to identify mule accounts in banks and freeze the deposits suspected to be proceeds of crime.The court also directed the IT intermediaries to preserve data relating to phones and equipment used by fraudsters, provide it to CBI and render full assistance to the central agency as and when sought in a particular case or in general.The bench further said that there is widespread breach of norms in issuance of SIM cards. ""Facts brought on record so far reveal an alarming negligent and irresponsible approach of telecom service providers while issuing multiple SIM cards in one name.
