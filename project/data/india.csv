‘Kochi Biennale challenges the practice of putting certain artists on a pedestal’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kochi-biennale-challenges-the-practice-of-putting-certain-artists-on-a-pedestal/articleshow/126100494.cms,"Nikhil Chopra

You were one of the OGs of

performance art

in India, back when it wasn’t even widely accepted as art. You’ve done things like eating and sleeping at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to trace the legacy of colonialism. As curator, the Biennale feels like it’s part of your attempt to expand the definition of art. Was that your aim?

Your curatorial team at HH Art Spaces brought together established artists like Marina Abramovic and our own Gulammohammed Sheikh alongside artists who don’t even have gallery representation. That’s unusual, isn’t it?

The Biennale also challenges the idea of art as something static or framed. There is Belgium-based Nigerian artist Otobong Nkanga who is growing a garden at Aspinwall and Argentine artist Adrián Villar Rojas who stuffed decaying food into obsolete fridges.

The theme is ‘For the Time Being’. What does ephemerality mean to you in this context?

Kochi itself feels deeply embedded in many of the works. Ghanaian artist Ibrahim Mahama was talking about how he sourced local sacks with the stamps of trade to turn a Mattancherry warehouse—a relic of its mercantile past—into a Parliament of Ghosts. How important was it that artists work closely with the city?

The Biennale positions itself outside the commercial art market, yet collectors are clearly keeping an eye out for promising artists. Are you surprised by that?

I’ve bumped into many locals and tourists here who admit they’ve never been to a gallery before, and many don’t have an ‘arty’ vocabulary. But you’ve spoken about how it’s okay if audiences don’t understand everything.

Finally, what do you think is the function of a Biennale for someone encountering contemporary art for the first time?

There were some grumbles about the spaces opening while many works were still in process. Did that unfinished state bother you?

The Kochi-Muziris Biennale has never been about polished spectacle. Instead of wine and cheese, there are fried banana fritters, a curator dressed in shorts, with some works unfinished and others still finding their rhythm. Neelam Raaj spoke to curatoron why he wanted to blur hierarchies and invite viewers to experience contemporary art as something dynamic rather than fixedWhat interested me here was working with forms that don’t sit neatly in one category. Take the performance of French artist Uriel Barthélém. He is a drummer and composer but his was not just a music performance, it was also an experimental percussion and visual work. The drum kit is programmed to generate visuals, creating a multidimensional, multisensory experience. For me, it was almost like watching a live painting unfold.It was very much about dismantling hierarchy. We wanted to stop working with a pyramid structure where certain artists are placed on pedestals. By placing emerging artists alongside figures with established practices, the intention was to level the playing field and push back against gatekeeping.It allows younger voices to see their own work and research in dialogue with art history and excellence, and to recognise the strength of their own journeys.Yes, art here is meant to be dynamic. Take Otobong’s garden, for example. It’s freshly planted now, but it will grow and change over the course of the Biennale. Time becomes a material. We have three months to cultivate this exhibition, almost like a garden, and that duration allows works to transform.It’s a series of moments. The Biennale has a beginning and an end, an entry and an exit. We’re acknowledging that we’re passing through time and place. Many of us have been living in Kochi for months, treating it as a residence rather than a temporary site. That kind of immersion is essential.Very much so. Many artists sourced materials locally, worked with students, carpenters, craftspeople, and technicians here. We’re crediting everyone involved, and their names will appear alongside the wall texts and in the catalogue. This exhibition was made collectively, with the city.Artists need to sustain their lives. If art can become an agency for them, there’s nothing wrong with it. For me personally, as a performance artist, I never initially thought about my relationship with the market. Over time, drawing became a sustainable practice that fed my performances, and the performances fed the drawings. It became a symbiotic relationship.That openness is crucial. Someone told me they didn’t understand everything, but they understood what they liked, and that was enough. Local residents, international visitors, first-time viewers, and specialists, everyone is invited to experience it on their own terms.This Biennale, in many ways, is about demystifying making, watching, and interacting with art. It’s about instilling faith in the idea that art and poetry are essential to people’s lives. Contemporary art has the ability to poetically approach difficult conversations— about caste, gender, patriarchy, sexuality—within a space that feels safe and open. The aim is to allow people in, to break away from the white cube of galleries, and to make art feel lived, shared, and human.From the beginning, our curatorial note made it clear that we weren’t afraid of inviting people into that process. Some works were still being adjusted, some artists hadn’t fully completed their installations, and that was fine. People could walk through, see what was there, and also sense that things were still being fixed and tuned. Soon, everything will find its place, but the exhibition itself functions as an activation space over time.","The kochi-muziris biennale is currently running.

SRINAGAR: Days after J&K CM Omar Abdullah described the “vote chori” as an issue of the Congress alone and said the INDIA bloc had “nothing to do with it,” the party on Saturday said being in alliance does not negate a constituent’s political ideology.“Omar Abdullah was present in various meetings of the INDIA bloc, whether they took place in Kolkata or elsewhere. The alliance was very successful in the parliamentary elections, though we have not achieved 100 percent success,” Congress’s Salman Khurshid said responding to question whether Omar is drifting away from the alliance.“Alliance is not a negation of independent political parties. They don’t write off their own identity and own ideology,” Khurshid said at a press conference here.On Dec 15, J&K CM distanced himself from the “vote chori” issue raised by the Congress and said the “INDIA bloc has got nothing to do with it”.Early this week, he repeated the statement in New Delhi.Khurshid said Jammu and Kashmir ’s demand for statehood was a fight for its very existence, describing statehood as an identity that had been taken away.He also questioned the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from the rural employment law MGNREGA . “What was the need to change the name of the scheme?” he said, adding that it is an emotive issue for the Congress.Omar echoed his comments, saying no one could erase Gandhi’s legacy, irrespective of whether his name remained attached to the scheme. “Mahatma Gandhi lives in the hearts of the people of India,” he said, describing the original scheme as far-sighted. He accused the NDA government of attempting to weaken the MGNREGA by shifting its financial burden on the states, saying the Centre ultimately wanted to do away with it altogether.","Omar abdullah was present in various meetings of the india bloc, whether they took place in kolkata or elsewhere. “alliance is not a negation of independent political parties.

‘Who named G-RAM G Bill?’



SRINAGAR: J&K Omar Abdullah Saturday praised the Centre for being generous in allocating funds to J&K, but said the same magnanimity had not been shown in the matter of restoring statehood.Omar said he had no hesitation in acknowledging and thanking the Centre’s efforts where it had delivered. “I am not among those who practise politics by deceiving people. Whenever the Centre extends support, I acknowledge it; and wherever there are shortcomings, I also speak about it,” he added.The CM was responding to media persons’ queries about the opposition’s accusations that he praised BJP in Delhi, but criticises it in Kashmir. At a meeting in New Delhi recently, Omar had said the Centre had been generous to J&K, even though, if it wanted, it could have brought his govt to its knees. Opposition parties in Kashmir widely criticised him for the statement, referring to him as “good boy” and alleging that he spoke in different voices in Delhi and Srinagar.Rejecting the criticism, Omar said he did not make statements to please anyone. “I do not say one thing in Delhi and another in Kashmir. I say this (praising Union govt over funds allocation) everywhere --- in public meetings, in official interactions and even on the floor of the Assembly,” he said.Omar said the Centre had left no scope for complaint on issues other than statehood restoration, a commitment it has not fulfilled.Criticising the new rural employment guarantee Bill that has been brought to replace MGNREGA , Omar said the Centre had shifted the financial and administrative burden of the programme on the states.The CM was in Srinagar to review the winter preparedness of the administration.Omar Abdullah poked fun at the renaming of MGNREGA as ‘Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin), or VB-G RAM G, Omar Abdullah said the acronym sounded like a Bollywood movie’s name.“First of all, I am surprised where this name came from,” he said. “I am sorry, but a Bill should have been named after giving it some thought. It reminds me of an old Bollywood movie, ‘Ji Mummy Ji’. I don’t know if you have seen it or not, my nephew has,” he added. “Who named the bill as G RAM G?” he asked. He also criticised the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from the scheme.","Omar said he had no hesitation in acknowledging and thanking the centre’s efforts where it had delivered.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor at the centre of the recent hijab row after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar lifted her naqab during an event did not join duty on Saturday, officials confirmed to news agency PTI. They also reported no contact with her or the family members.Patna civil surgeon Avinash Kumar Singh confirmed that Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.“I have been informed that the last date of joining has been extended beyond December 20. It remains to be seen whether Parveen joins on Monday or not,” he said, without specifying the new deadline.The controversy erupted earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna. The video circulated widely on social media, capturing the moment Nitish Kumar questioned Parveen’s naqab when she came forward to receive her appointment letter along with other Ayush doctors.Also Read: Hijab row: SCBA issues 'strongest condemnation' over Nitish Kumar's act; seeks unconditional apology from Giriraj Singh, Sanjay Nishad Civil surgeon Singh said he was not aware of the reason for Parveen’s delay, as he “had no contact with her or the family members.”Vijay Kumar, a surgeon at Sabalpur PHC in Patna Sadar, where Parveen was supposed to join, also confirmed she had not reported for duty.“Around five-six people have joined today, and Parveen is not among them... Her name is in the list but we have not received her appointment letter from the civil surgeon office in Patna,” he said. As per protocol, candidates must first report to the civil surgeon’s office before joining their assigned workplace.Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammad Khan expressed disappointment over the controversy.“It pains me to hear the word ‘dispute’ in this case. Can there be any row between a father and a daughter?” he asked.“What have you people made out of it? This man (Nitish Kumar) considers female students as his daughters,” he added while speaking to reporters in Patna.Earlier, Mahfoozur Rahman, principal of Government Tibbi College & Hospital (GTCH), where Parveen is a second-year student, also suggested the joining deadline had been extended “in this special case”.“Ayush doctor Nusrat Parveen has not joined yet, and there is no update on her future course of action,” Rahman said.According to him, the family wants to avoid media attention. “Her family said that they want to escape media coverage, and that the woman doctor will rethink whether to join or not,” he said.Rahman also dismissed rumours that the family had shifted to Kolkata. “They have themselves rubbished such false news reports,” he said, quoting Parveen’s husband as saying the family is not upset with Nitish Kumar or the government.He added that “the family is disappointed with the row stirred by the media.”Rahman said Parveen last attended college on December 17 or 18 and noted that she still has the option to either join duty or pursue higher education.","Nusrat parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day’ closed.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Saturday issued a letter expressing its “strongest condemnation” of the recent incident in Bihar in which CM Nitish Kumar pulled down the hijab of a woman doctor during a public ceremony.The incident, which occurred on December 15 at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna during the distribution of appointment letters to newly recruited AYUSH doctors, was captured in a video that quickly went viral.The clip showed Nitish questioning the woman’s naqab, saying “what is this?” and then attempting to remove it, leaving the doctor visibly flustered. Deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary appeared to intervene to restrain him.In a post on X, RJD wrote: ""What has happened to Nitish ji? His mental state has now reached a completely pitiable condition, or has Nitish Babu become 100% Sanghi now?""In its letter, the SCBA condemned the Bihar CM’s action as an infringement on the woman’s autonomy, religious freedom and personal dignity.It stated, “Besides infringing on her autonomy, agency and religious freedom, it is a reflection of the depraving attitude against women in general.”The association also condemned “the vile comments made by union minister Giriraj Singh and Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad,” saying such remarks further undermined the dignity of women. Signed by SCBA secretary Pragya Baghel, the letter demanded an unconditional apology from the chief minister and others involved.The controversy escalated after union minister Giriraj Singh defended Nitish, describing the incident as “nothing wrong” and framing it as a procedural act.Singh said it was up to the woman to refuse the government job or “go to hell” and argued that the act should not be seen through a religious lens.He drew parallels to other official procedures, stating, “When you go to get a passport, do you not show your face? When you go to the airport, do you not show your face? People talk about Pakistan and Englishtan, but this is India. In India, the rule of law prevails.”Similarly, Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad’s remarks defending Bihar CM were widely criticised. Nishad initially supported Nitish’s action but later said his comments were misunderstood due to translation issues and offered to withdraw them if they had hurt sentiments.Despite this, opposition leaders continued to demand an unconditional apology from both ministers.","Supreme court bar association (scba) condemns bihar cm nitish kumar's act.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s helicopter could not land at the Taherpur helipad in West Bengal on Saturday due to low visibility caused by dense fog, an official said.The Prime Minister’s chopper hovered over the helipad for some time before making a U turn and returning to Kolkata airport, the official added. There were no reports of any untoward incident.As of the last update, PM Modi was waiting at the airport for further information on the weather conditions. It was not immediately clear whether he would travel to the venue by road or make another aerial attempt if visibility improves, the official said.Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister arrived in Kolkata at around 10.40 am and proceeded by helicopter to Taherpur in Nadia district. He is scheduled to attend an administrative programme to launch highway projects in West Bengal, followed by a BJP rally titled Parivartan Sankalpa Sabha.People gathered at Taherpur Netaji Park in Ranaghat, Nadia district, on Saturday, waving national flags and chanting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name ahead of his public address and the inauguration of development projects worth Rs 3,200 crore in West Bengal.The projects include a 66.7 km four lane stretch of the Barajaguli Krishnanagar section of National Highway 34 and the laying of the foundation stone for the four laning of the Barasat Barajaguli section of NH 34, aimed at improving connectivity between Kolkata and Siliguri.According to the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Modi was scheduled to reach Ranaghat at around 11.15 am. The visit was part of an administrative programme to launch highway projects, followed by a BJP rally titled Parivartan Sankalpa Sabha.Ahead of the visit, the Prime Minister criticised the Trinamool Congress government in a post on X on Friday, saying people in West Bengal were benefiting from the Centre’s development initiatives but continued to suffer due to what he described as “misrule of the Trinamool Congress in every sector.”“Tomorrow, on the 20th of December, at noon, I will deliver a speech at the BJP public meeting in Ranaghat. The people of West Bengal are receiving the benefits of the central government's multifaceted projects. However, at the same time, due to the misrule of the Trinamool Congress in every sector of the state, they are becoming victims of suffering. The looting and intimidation by the Trinamool have crossed all limits. That is why today, the BJP is the only hope and trust of the people,” PM Modi said in the post.The West Bengal visit comes amid an intensifying political contest between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress ahead of upcoming electoral battles in the state.After his programme in West Bengal,PM Modi will travel to Assam for a two day visit on December 20 and 21. He is scheduled to reach Guwahati around 3 pm on Saturday, where he will inaugurate the new Bamboo Orchids terminal at the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport, unveil an 80 foot tall statue of Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi, and lay the foundation stone for a 12 lakh metric tonne capacity fertiliser unit at Namrup in Dibrugarh district.During his Assam visit, the Prime Minister will address public rallies in Guwahati and Namrup and visit the Assam state BJP headquarters. On December 21, he will interact with 25 meritorious students as part of Pariksha Pe Charcha during a programme on a cruise on the Brahmaputra river and pay tributes to 860 martyrs of the Assam Movement at Swahid Smarak.Authorities have deployed extensive security arrangements across Guwahati and other key locations to manage the Prime Minister’s schedule and ensure public safety during the visit.","The prime minister’s chopper hovered over the helipad for some time before making a u turn and returning to kolkata airport.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday announced that it will contest the upcoming Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections alone, a decision confirmed by party leader Ramesh Chennithala while speaking to ANI news agency.“We are all ready for the BMC elections . I have come to attend the meeting… Congress has taken a decision to contest the elections alone,” Chennithala said.The announcement comes amid one of the most striking political developments in Mumbai ahead of the polls, the growing proximity between Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena supremo Raj Thackeray .Once bitter rivals, the cousins now appear aligned in their belief that losing Mumbai would significantly weaken the broader Thackeray political legacy.For Uddhav Thackeray, winning control of the BMC may be the last major opportunity to reassert political relevance after the 2022 split in the Shiv Sena . For Raj Thackeray, the election is being framed as a battle to safeguard Marathi identity, with the MNS presenting itself as the custodian of Maharashtra's linguistic and cultural character.While no formal announcement has been made yet, the Sena (UBT) and MNS are expected to declare their alliance for the BMC polls next week.Notably, the Congress is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance in Maharashtra, alongside Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena (UBT) and Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP - SP).In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly elections, the MVA suffered a major setback, losing heavily to the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance, which secured a landslide victory.Polling for BMC's 29 municipal corporations, 32 zilla parishads and 336 panchayat samitis will be held on January 15, with results to be declared the following day on January 16.","The congress on saturday announced that it will contest the upcoming brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) elections alone.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

NEW DELHI: Advocate Vishnu Joshi, representing a victim’s family in the Goa nightclub fire case, on Wednesday said that one of the Luthra brothers requested a Dunlop mattress during police remand.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before granting custody. Speaking to reporters, he said, “Today, when the Goa Police presented them in court, one accused, during their arguments, claimed he had spinal issues and other health problems. He requested that they be provided with a Dunlop mattress during their police remand. The state strongly opposed this... Their pre-medical examination showed them to be perfectly fit. ”He added that the duo had attempted to evade legal proceedings since fleeing India.“Since these people (Luthra brothers) absconded and fled the country, they have been employing tactics to somehow escape. First, they filed an anticipatory bail application on vague grounds in the Rohini Court, even though that court had no jurisdiction... But that bail application was rejected. Since then, they have been trying wherever they get a chance to obtain some kind of relaxation,” Joshi said.Joshi explained that the court carefully considered the brothers’ health claims before ordering custody.“The brothers claimed to be suffering from back pain. The court considered all submissions and directed the police to first conduct a pre-medical examination and re-examination. No medical necessity was found, following which the court, exercising its full authority, granted five days of police remand,” he said.The Luthra brothers, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, were remanded to five-day police custody by the Mapusa Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court.They were brought back to Goa from Thailand following their deportation and produced before the court after undergoing multiple medical examinations.After landing at Manohar International Airport, Mopa, under police escort around 10.45 am, the duo was taken to a primary health centre in Siolim and then to the District Hospital in Mapusa. The court directed fresh medical examinations before ordering the five-day custody to allow investigators to question them regarding alleged safety lapses at the club.The blaze broke out on December 6 around 11.45 pm during a crowded event at the nightclub, when electric firecrackers allegedly struck the wooden ceiling. The incident claimed the lives of 25 people, including tourists and staff, while several others were injured.Police said the brothers fled India hours after the incident on December 7, leaving for Thailand while rescue operations were under way. Goa Police launched a nationwide and international manhunt, issued a lookout circular and sought an Interpol Blue Notice.Following their detention by Thai authorities for illegal stay and the suspension of their passports, the brothers were deported to India on emergency travel documents.They landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday and were arrested by Goa Police, who obtained a 48-hour transit remand from a Delhi court to facilitate their return to Goa.They have been booked under several provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence. Investigators have also arrested several others linked to the nightclub’s operations and are probing allegations that the venue was operating with expired licences and without mandatory safety clearances.","Advocate vishnu joshi, representing victim's family, says one of the luthra brothers requested a dunlop mattress during police remand.

Sonia Gandhi Criticises PM Modi Over VB-G RAM G Bill And MGNREGA Rollback

What is VB–G RAM G?

NEW DELHI: Congress Rajya Sabha member Sonia Gandhi, reacting to the VB-G RAM G Bill, criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing the central government of attacking the interests of the poor by ""running a bulldozer over MGNREGA "".Sonia Gandhi alleged that the Modi government, over the past 11 years, has ""consistently tried to weaken MGNREGA by neglecting the interests of the rural unemployed, the poor and the marginalised, even though the scheme proved to be a lifeline for these sections during the Covid crisis"".""While the Congress played a major role in bringing MGNREGA into existence and implementing it, the scheme was never about a political party. It was about national interest and public welfare. By weakening this law, the Modi government has attacked the interests of crores of farmers, workers and landless rural poor,"" the former Congress chief claimed.The Rajya Sabha MP further said: ""The Congress had a major contribution in bringing and implementing MGNREGA. It was a scheme connected to the interest of the country and the people. The Modi government has attacked the interests of the poor through this.""'VB-G Ram G' bill, which awaits the President's nod, was passed amid fierce protest by the opposition, particularly the INDIA bloc during the Winter Session of the Parliament.On Thursday, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, speaking in favour of the bill, claimed that the legislation improves substantially on MGNREGA, which was ""riddled"" by corruption and inefficiency.The opposition was demanding that the bill be sent to a parliamentary committee for scrutiny and assailed the government for removing Mahatma Gandhi 's name from the rural employment guarantee scheme.As Chouhan began his reply after Congress MP KC Venugopal's demand for sending Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission-Gramin (VB-G RAM G) Bill to the committee went unheeded, opposition members trooped into the well, tore its copies and continued their protest till the House passed the bill.The government has repealed the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047.The Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025 represents a major overhaul of MNREGA. Under the proposed law, the government ""establishes a modern statutory framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047, guaranteeing 125 days of wage employment per rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work,"" as per a statement released.","Sonia gandhi criticises pm modi over vb-g ram g bill and mgnrega rollback.

NEW DELHI: The government has ordered a probe into the case of an Air India Express pilot beating up a passenger at Delhi Airport’s Terminal 1 on Friday. The two had a verbal spat between two before Captain Virender Sejwal assaulted the passenger, Ankit Dewan. Why no one, including CISF personnel posted at the entrance, intervened in time, and the matter escalated to such an extent, is being examined.“The ministry of civil aviation has taken serious cognisance of the incident and directed the airline to ground the pilot with immediate effect. A formal enquiry has been ordered. Detailed reports have been sought from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF),” the ministry said on X Saturday. No police complaint has been lodged so far in this case.The Air India Express was “dead heading” to Bengaluru — travelling as a passenger to another place to operate a flight from there — on IndiGo. Dewan was travelling with his family on SpiceJet. After the fight, they went to their destinations. AI Express grounded Captain Sejwal, and he didn’t operate the flight he was rostered to from Bengaluru.What allegedly happened: While Captain Virender Sejwal was at the staff entry gate, CISF personnel directed Dewan to this gate as he was travelling with young children and baggage.He was on one side of the entrance, and the pilot was on the other. “Captain Sejwal was going ahead of his side of the queue being a crew member. Dewan started questioning this in a not very decent language or tone. The CISF personnel asked him not to speak like that. When he did not stop, the captain hit him. The personnel on duty immediately separated them,” said CISF sources.“Our personnel asked Dewan if he wanted to file a police complaint so that they could take him to the airport police station. He gave in writing that he did not want to do so. Both the pilot and Dewan with his family went to their destinations,” CISF sources added.On reaching his destination, Dewan, “a credit card & miles enthusiast”, said on X Friday night: “…one of (AI Express) pilots, Captain Virender Sejwal, assaulted me physically at T1, Delhi Airport. Me & my family were guided to use the security check that the staff uses, because we had a 4-month-old baby in a stroller. The staff was cutting the queue ahead of me. On calling them out, Captain Virender, who himself was doing the same thing, asked me if I was anpadh (uneducated), and couldn't read the signs that said this entry was for staff. A verbal scuffle broke out. Not able to exercise restraint, the AI Express pilot proceeded to physically assault me, leaving me bloody.”Dewan added that he had to “see a doctor” and that his “7-year-old daughter, who saw her father get assaulted brutally, is still traumatised & scared.” “I have no clue how DGCA and Air India Express can allow such pilots to fly. If they can't keep their cool in a scuffle, can they be trusted with the lives of hundreds of people in the sky? How can Delhi Airport get away with such mismanagement, combining staff entry with passengers carrying infants, creating chaos at a sensitive security area? I thought airports were safe places!”An AI Express spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident at Delhi Airport involving one of our employees, who was travelling as a passenger on another airline, and had an altercation with another passenger. We unequivocally condemn such behaviour. The employee concerned has been removed from official duties with immediate effect, pending investigation. Appropriate disciplinary action will be initiated based on the findings of the inquiry. Air India Express upholds the highest standards of conduct and professionalism, and remains committed to ensuring that its employees act responsibly at all times.”Dewan added on X: “I was forced to write a letter stating that I will not pursue this matter further. It was either write that letter, or miss my flight and throw the 1.2 lakh holiday bookings down the drain. Delhi police, why can't I file a complaint after coming back? Must I sacrifice my money too, to seek justice? Will the CCTV footage disappear in the two days till I make it back to Delhi?""","The government has ordered a probe into the case of an air india express pilot beating up a passenger at delhi airport’s terminal 1 on friday.

The family reported that initial calls to emergency services went unanswered, and the investigation only gained momentum after the father contacted a personal acquaintance in the Noida police department.Providing details, additional district govt counsel (ADGC) Varun Kaushik, said, ""Forensic evidence, including semen traces matching the convicts, played a crucial role.""""The court convicted Zuber alias Parvez (35), Mohd Sajid (37) both from Kannauj, and Dharamveer Singh (36), Sunil Kumar (35), Naresh Kumar (46), from Farrukhabad district. Saleem Bawaria (45) - the gang's kingpin - died during the court trial in Dec 2019,"" he added.The ADGC added that ""all the convicts were unable to secure bail and remained in jail since the incident."" ""Their bail was even rejected by the Supreme Court,"" he said. An FIR was registered on the afternoon of July 30, that year, under sections 394, 395, 397 (aggravated forms of robbery and dacoity), 376-D (gangrape), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, and 5/6 of the Pocso Act.""The next day, police arrested Mohd Riyazuddin, Mohd Shahwez and Jabar Singh from Haryana. They were, however, later given clean chit by CBI and let-off,"" Kaushik said. The gravity of the incident led to a CBI probe ordered by the Allahabad high court and resulted in the suspension of several high-ranking police officers for ""negligence"".Notably, the apex court also reprimanded then-UP cabinet minister Azam Khan for calling the incident a ""political conspiracy by the Opposition"". Khan later tendered an apology in court. TOI's extensive coverage at that time exposed the vulnerability of the travellers on desolate stretches of the UP highways, some of them without adequate road lights.Twenty-five witnesses provided testimony during the trial. Of the 11 individuals implicated, the legal outcomes varied - two suspects died in police encounters, one passed away in custody due to illness and three were acquitted for lack of evidence. Saturday's conviction by additional district and sessions judge-III, Omprakash Verma, concluded the lengthy legal process.","The incident happened on july 29, 2016, when the family's vehicle was intercepted near a village, while they were travelling to shahjahanpur from noida.
