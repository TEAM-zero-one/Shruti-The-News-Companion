Yes – They drive accountability and productivity No – They increase pressure and reduce flexibility





BENGALURU: TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually, restricting their bench time to a maximum of 35 business days each year. The policy aims to foster a proactive approach towards associate allocation, ensuring both organisational and individual goals are met.""At any given point in time, associates must be allocated for a minimum period of 225 business days in the last 12 months,"" the document reviewed by TOI showed. ""Long periods of remaining unallocated shall adversely impact associate compensation, career growth, avenues of overseas deployment in future, and continuity of employment with the organisation,"" it said. The new policy, which came into effect on June 12, was laid out by Chandrasekaran Ramkumar, global head of The Resource Management Group (RMG).RMG at TCS oversees workforce deployment, ensuring the right talent with the right skills is assigned to projects. This team focuses on maximising organisational utilisation by making sure every associate is optimally engaged and allocated to projects at all times.""In the event an associate is unallocated, it is the primary responsibility of the associate to proactively engage with the Unit / Regional RMG for seeking allocation and take initiative towards pursuing suitable opportunities provided by the organisation,"" the policy said.All associates who are released to RMG, available for the next assignment, and reporting to RMG are unallocated resources.TCS provides opportunities through platforms like iEvolve, Fresco Play, VLS, and LinkedIn. While unallocated, associates are expected to spend 4-6 hours daily on relevant learning via iEvolve, complete all mandatory and prioritised training, attend in-person sessions as recommended by RMG, and actively upskill to stay interview-ready. They should also use the Gen AI interview coach, review and address feedback from past interviews, and complete all training programmes on time with full attendance.To facilitate swift deployment, TCS has called out that physical presence in the office is mandatory. As a result, WFO exceptions and flexible work arrangements are generally not applicable. ""However, associates may request short-term flexible work options for personal emergencies in exceptional circumstances, subject to organisational policies and prior approval from the RMG.""TCS has stated that frequent short-term allocations to multiple projects are discouraged and may lead to HR investigations and appropriate disciplinary measures. An email sent to TCS on the policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to the press.","Tcs's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually.

SHILLONG/INDORE: Sonam Raghuvanshi, who is in custody for the murder of her husband, Raja, was taken to Meghalaya Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences on Monday for a mental health assessment and was found mentally sound in a psychiatric examination, police sources said.In Indore, Sonam’s brother Govind said he has been summoned for questioning by Shillong police. The couple from Indore were honeymooning in Sohra last month when Raja was murdered. Sonam and four other accused — all from outside Meghalaya — remain in police custody as investigations continue.Authorities plan to take the five suspects to Sohra on Tuesday to recreate the crime scene, police sources said. A local court had initially granted eight-day police remand on June 11 to facilitate further investigation.Police are likely to seek extension of custody. In Indore, over 2,200km away, the ‘tehrvi’ (13th-day death ritual) for Raja was held at his home on Monday, attended by only close family and relatives, including Govind. “Shillong police have called me for questioning. They said I need to give a statement and sign it,” he said.Raja’s other brother, Sachin, said that the family had prepared all of Raja’s favourite dishes for the ritual, including gulab jamun, Manchurian, noodles, dal-chawal, dry fruits, bananas, and papaya.“We are not organising it like a typical tehrvi for a natural death; only family members are participating,” Sachin added.The Raghuvanshi family continues to grapple with unanswered questions. “The same question keeps coming to our minds: why did Sonam got her husband murdered just days after their wedding?” said Sachin, wondering if anyone apart from the five accused was also involved. The family has demanded a narco analysis test of all five accused.","Sonam raghuvanshi, who is in custody for the murder of her husband, raja, was taken to meghalaya institute of mental health and neurosciences on monday for a mental health assessment.

Each missed that Boeing Dreamliner's take-off from Ahmedabad on June 12 - each watched in disbelief as it vanished into flames.Yaman Vyas, a warehouse worker with a United Kingdom work permit, had his return to London plotted down to the last detail. After two years abroad, he had flown home to Vadodara for a brief visit. Passport? Check. Bags? Packed.

New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested on Tuesday at a federal immigration court in Manhattan. He was taken into custody after linking arms with a man whom federal agents were attempting to detain.Journalists and photographers captured the incident.Lander had spent the morning observing court proceedings and said he was there to “accompany” immigrants as they left the building. As one man stepped out of a courtroom, federal agents moved in to arrest him. Lander locked arms with the individual and asked to see a judicial warrant.Agents spent over 40 seconds trying to pull the two apart, dragging them down the hallway in a messy struggle. They eventually separated them and put handcuffs on Lander.“You’re obstructing,” one agent told him.“I’m not obstructing. I’m standing right here in the hallway,” Lander responded.According to US Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, Lander was arrested “for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.”The man Lander was escorting was also arrested. Lander was released after a few hours and walked out of the building holding hands with his wife and flanked by New York Governor Kathy Hochul, to cheers from supporters.He insisted he “certainly did not” assault anyone.“I am happy to report that I am just fine. I lost a button,” Lander told reporters. “I believe it is important to show up and bear witness and accompany people.”He added that the immigrant “ripped” from his arms “doesn’t have a lawyer” and will likely spend the night in a detention facility.The US attorney’s office confirmed it is reviewing the matter and will decide whether to press charges. “The safety and security of official proceedings, government officials, law enforcement officers, and all members of the public who participate in them is a core focus of our Office,” said spokesperson Nicholas Biase.The arrest comes as immigration agents conduct aggressive enforcement operations nationwide, often detaining immigrants outside courtrooms immediately after their cases are dismissed.Lander’s detention follows similar episodes involving other Democratic politicians. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested outside a detention centre last month, though his charge was later dropped. Rep. LaMonica McIver was charged with impeding officers at the same event. Last week, Senator Alex Padilla was physically removed from a press conference in Los Angeles for speaking out against raids.Lander’s rivals in the Democratic mayoral primary, now just days away, swiftly criticised his arrest. Former governor Andrew Cuomo called it an example of “the extreme thuggery of Trump’s ICE out of control.”Candidate Zohran Mamdani and governor Hochul both visited the scene, with Hochul likening the arrest to excrement in a post on X.",New york city comptroller and democratic mayoral candidate brad lander was arrested on tuesday at a federal immigration court in manhattan.

Why Venice locals are protesting against Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Wedding venue

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding, set for June 24 in Venice, is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists. Demonstrators have unfurled banners across historic churches, including the San Giorgio Maggiore Church, with slogans like “No Space for Bezos”, signaling their frustration over the lavish event. The $10 million celebration, planned on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, has triggered protests over blocked streets, luxury hotel takeovers, and environmental concerns, threatening to disrupt the Floating City during its peak tourist season.One of the most striking acts of dissent saw a large banner unfurled from the bell tower of the historic San Giorgio Maggiore Church. The banner, featuring a bold red 'X' slashing through Bezos's name, sent a clear visual message across the lagoon, quickly garnering attention on social media platforms. Flyers with similar slogans, including ""No space for oligarchs, no space for Bezos,"" have also been plastered across the city.The protests stem from concerns that Bezos’ wedding, scheduled for June 24-26, is turning Venice into a “playground for the ultra-wealthy”, exacerbating issues of overtourism, restricted public access, and environmental strain. Activists claim that Bezos has reserved luxury hotels, water taxis, and even an entire island, limiting movement for locals during peak tourist season.Local activist group Laboratorio Occupato Morion , which describes itself as an ""anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anti-racist, and trans-feminist political space,"" is leading the charge against the event. Alice Bazzoli, a spokesperson for the Laboratorio Occupato Morion, a local activist group, stated: ""Bezos thinks he can buy the entire city. We refuse to let Venice be held hostage by one of the richest men in the world.""Organisers emphasise that their actions are not a personal attack on Bezos and Sanchez, but rather a broader statement against the disruptive nature of such events in a city already grappling with immense pressure.The couple is likely to host their guests at Scuola Grande della Misericordia. Built in 1310, the historical building was originally one of Venice’s Seven Scuole Grandi, a site reserved for city’s elite. The venue consists of grand frescoes by Renaissance masters such as Tintoretto, Veronese, and Pellegrini, making it one of the most opulent locations in the city. The building, which has been repurposed for exhibitions and events, can accommodate up to 1,000 guests.The wedding, scheduled for the weekend of June 24, is expected to host Hollywood stars, business moguls, and political figures. Among the rumored guests are Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and Eva Longoria.","Jeff bezos and lauren sanchez's wedding is facing a fierce backlash from local residents and activists.

KOLKATA: Calcutta HC temporarily stayed Tuesday Bengal govt's new OBC list of 140 sub-groups - 80 Muslim, 60 non-Muslim - till July 31, halting a move that had replaced the earlier 113-group list struck down by the court in May last year.A division bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Rajasekhar Mantha paused the June 3 gazette notification and all related state orders, including the portal inviting OBC caste certificate applications. HC found procedural flaws in the state's execution under West Bengal Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993, after the 2012 law had been adopted.""The next obvious step after passing the draft notification on OBC laid in the assembly would have been to introduce an amendment to the 2012 Act,"" said Justice Mantha. ""You complied with the legislative procedure the court ordered in May 2024. But then you abandoned the 2012 Act and took steps under the 1993 Act.""Justice Chakraborty questioned why the state was pushing ahead when the matter was pending before Supreme Court. ""Keep your hands off until Supreme Court hears the matter. We are not going to pass any interim order,"" he said. Supreme Court's next hearing is scheduled for July.Bengal govt is weighing a challenge to the temporary stay. ""It is an interlocutory order, but there are grounds to appeal. The apex court was informed during the March hearing that a fresh survey was underway,"" a senior official said.The new list expanded the number of Muslim sub-groups from 77 to 80 and non-Muslim groups from 36 to 60. CM Mamata Banerjee had defended the formula last week: ""Backwardness, not religion, was the sole criterion in the fresh OBC survey in Bengal.""The stay could affect admissions and recruitment as current OBC reservations will drop below 17% without the expanded list.Senior counsel S Sriram, representing the petitioner, said the executive had no authority under the 2012 Act to declare OBC reservations. ""The 2012 Act explicitly states that only the legislature can make provisions for reservation under the Act or Article 16(4) of the Constitution,"" he said.",Calcutta hc temporarily stayed bengal govt's new obc list of 140 sub-groups.

Centre-Tamil Nadu dispute over Keeladi find claims 1st victim: ASI director shunted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-tamil-nadu-dispute-over-keeladi-find-claims-1st-victim-asi-director-shunted/articleshow/121916984.cms,"TN govt had revived archaeological excavations in the state to further its narrative of Dravidian glory of yore

After sparring with the Tamil Nadu govt over the antiquity of archaeological finds at Keeladi, the Union govt has removed Amarnath Ramakrishna as ASI director (antiquity). Ramakrishna had submitted a report that said the south Tamil Nadu finds were from the 8th century BCE.After Union culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said on June 10 that the Keeladi report was not scientifically sound, TN chief minister M K Stalin criticised the Centre, saying it's not the report but some mindsets that need to be changed. Tamil Nadu's govt had revived archaeological excavations in the state to further its narrative of Dravidian glory of yore.ASI director (exploration & excavation) Hemasagar A Naik, who sent a letter to Amarnath on May 21 seeking ""concrete justification"" for the dating of the Keeladi findings - and received a sharp response from Ramakrishna - will now head the antiquities department. Ramakrishna will remain in charge of the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities (NMMA). Sources said NMMA, set up by the govt in 2007 to create two national registers to document monuments and antiquities across the country, has been virtually defunct.On May 23, Ramakrishna replied to Naik's letter stating that the period of Keeladi excavation ""was reconstructed as per the stratigraphical sequence, cultural deposit available with material culture, and with accelerator mass spectrometry"".He added, ""The final outcome of the observation of the excavator was incorporated in the final report with all documentary evidence, and the chronological sequence of the Keeladi site was clearly explained in the report. ""In his letter, Naik said, ""The date of the earlier period (8thcentury BCE to 5th century BCE) in the present state of our knowledge appears to be very early and that it can be, at the maximum, somewhere in pre-300 BCE.""Ramakrishna was firm in his reply: ""The view expressed by you for further examination of sequence is against the well-reasoned conclusive finding of the excavator of the site.""To Naik's observation that ""only mentioning the depth for the available scientific dates is not enough but the layer number should also be marked for comparative consistency analysis"", Ramakrishna replied, ""Layer numbering will be done if it is found missing."" Finally, on Naik's insistence that the submitted maps may be replaced with better ones, that the village map lacked clarity, some plates were missing, drawings were missing, and trenches/cuttings required, Ramakrishna replied that ""all relevant maps, plates and drawings were given in high resolution format"".Recently, Shekhawat had said the report on Keeladi submitted by Ramakrishna was not ""technically well-supported"" and more data was required. ""The report is not technically well-supported and established yet. A lot of things are to be done before recognition and accreditation are accorded to the findings presented by the archaeologist. Let them come up with more results, more data, evidence, and proof. One finding cannot change the discourse of history,"" he had said.",Tamil nadu govt had revived archaeological excavations in the state to further its narrative of dravidian glory of yore.

"Ahmedabad Plane Crash: 'Are we not humans?': Doctor covered in soot, asks for time to shift belongings after Ahmedabad plane crash; later issues clarification as BJMC confirms support",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/doctors-distress-call-gain-attention-all-medics-rehoused-bjmc/articleshow/121854928.cms,"



AHMEDABAD: A doctor's emotional plea for time to vacate the crash-damaged quarters near BJ Medical College struck a chord online early Saturday. The video showed Anil Panwar, a cardiac anaesthetist at UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre (UNMICRC), describing the difficulty of relocating while tending to an unwell child.Even as the appeal garnered widespread concern and sympathy, Dr Panwar posted a second video, clarifying that his earlier remarks were made in a moment of stress and that his family had, in fact, been provided accommodation. BJMC authorities, meanwhile, confirmed that all junior doctors and faculty members who were displaced have been allotted new accommodation.The initial video, filmed on Friday night near the residential quarters, showed Dr Panwar standing among packed belongings, his voice trembling as he spoke of the urgency and pressure to vacate. He said the administration had asked them to vacate the quarters immediately as they planned to demolish parts of the buildings as part of the relief and rescue work.""Are we not humans? Can't you give us 2-3 days? We need some basic goods to run the house. Several of our doctors are admitted (to the hospital for treatment). We are troubled... Understand that it is not easy to clear a house overnight,"" said Dr Panwar, who was covered in soot from attempting to shift his belongings.He was on duty when the tragedy took place.""I pray to you with folded hands that give us 2-3 days' time. My child is admitted, and I should be with her. Instead, I am here (at the site, clearing belongings). Convey my message to the higher-ups as I am helpless. I am not from Gujarat, and I need some time to shift,"" he said. His wife, Dr Chanchal Bhandari, also a cardiac anaesthetist, had grabbed attention a day ago when news broke out of how her heroism and her nanny's presence of mind helped them save her two-year-old daughter's life after the ill-fated plane crashed onto the hostel buildings.The appeal, shared widely across social media platforms, drew empathy and concern from citizens and medical professionals alike, many of whom highlighted the psychological and physical toll the crash had taken on healthcare workers already coping with long shifts and trauma.However, by Saturday afternoon, Dr Panwar issued a second statement. In a video message, he said that the earlier remarks were made in a moment of stress and confusion, and that he had not been aware that his wife — also a doctor — had already been allotted temporary housing by hospital authorities ""I was mentally disturbed and didn't know what I was saying,"" he said. ""Volunteers helped us shift our belongings. I again thank the hospital and government authorities,"" he said in the video.The clarification came as the BJ Medical College administration announced that a total of 159 accommodations had been arranged for residents from the damaged hostels and staff quarters.Dr Minakshi Parikh, dean of BJMC, said that 100 students from Atulyam 2 and 3 had been moved to the GCRI Old Block and Digvijaya Lions Hostel. Another 38 residents from Atulyam 1 were relocated to PG Hostel wings ON MediCity campus, the Mithila quarters, and the UN Mehta hostel. Twenty-one residents from Atulyam 4 were shifted to the Dental College quarters and Mithila 2 quarters. ""All affected students and residents have been shifted to new accommodations as of Saturday,"" she confirmed.Some junior doctors, speaking anonymously, acknowledged that the shifting process was not without hurdles as the relief and rescue work was going on all around. ""Almost all of us were reporting to duty due to the scale of the catastrophe. But one can understand that the authorities are also pressed on multiple fronts. The seniors and staffers also helped us, and almost all have now been shifted to new accommodations,"" said a doctor. Several voluntary organizations are providing meals and other help to the affected residents, said officials.","Anil panwar, a cardiac anaesthetist at un mehta institute of cardiology and research centre, made emotional plea for time to vacate quarters near bj medical college.

MUMBAI: In the corner of a school corridor in south Kolkata, a retired Sanskrit teacher quietly takes a class without pay. Down the hallway, a part-time Hindi teacher, paid just Rs 5,000 a month, juggles syllabi and student disinterest.These are not isolated cases — they are scenes repeating across campuses of India, where the three-language formula of the National Education Policy (NEP) is a muddled mosaic of politics, policy and pedagogy.The idea is simple on paper: every child in India should learn three languages — preferably the mother tongue, Hindi or English, and one more Indian language. But in practice, the “third language” is often the orphaned child of the curriculum — chronically underfunded, sporadically taught, rarely enjoyed.NEP recommended three languages to promote “multilingualism, national unity, and cognitive development.” The policy says: “The three languages learned by children will be the choices of states, regions, and of the students themselves, so long as at least two of the three languages are native to India.”In essence, the policy is designed to “balance local relevance with national cohesion and global readiness”. However, linguist Peggy Mohan says, “Not only does it not help, we don’t have teachers to teach it.They are already overstressed with understanding English texts. Language is not an intellectual accomplishment. People learn languages if demanded by their environment. As usual politicians are loading their issues onto children. ”In West Bengal, where the State Education Policy was introduced as a counterweight to the Centre’s NEP, the third language begins in Class 5 — if schools can ﬁnd someone to teach it. Hindi or Sanskrit is usually the choice for Classes 7 and 8, or in some cases Urdu, but few institutions allocate full-time teachers for them. So principals improvise.“We employ a retired Sanskrit teacher on an honorary basis and a part-time Hindi teacher,” says Amit Sen Majumder of Jodhpur Park Boys’ School in south Kolkata. However, the pay can be as little as Rs 5,000.Keeping students engaged and convincing parents is equally a daunting task. Anjana Dutta, whose son is in Class 7 at a south Kolkata school, said, “Students are reluctant to study a third language, knowing it’s only for two years. Govt should ensure proper teaching and offer language options that could be useful later.”Incidentally, Bengali is taught compulsorily from Class 1. And while ASER (Annual Status of Education Report) 2024 paints a picture of improvement in the state — 71.3% of Class 8 students can read a Class 2-level text — parents are not entirely impressed with the standards.In Bihar, the formula includes Hindi, English and Sanskrit or Urdu — but again, the approach smacks of lip service. “Some schools have students without teachers; others have teachers without students,” admits ManojKumar, working president, State Primary Teachers’ Association. It’s not surprising, as sanctioned posts for language teachers has not kept pace with increase in students.Retired Patna University teacher and Sahitya Akademi Award winner Arun Kamal points out that studentshere mostly opt for Sanskrit as third language besides Hindi and English. Even as there is a facility for Bengali teaching in some schools, there are very few teachers for the subject. “We don’t offer enough options. There is no imaginative engagement.”Even Maithili, which is spoken in 148assembly constituencies and has been included in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution, is not taught in schools as yet. Linguist Bhairav Lal Das says Maithili is a popular language with a rich history but has not yet been made the medium of instruction even in the Mithilanchal (Maithili belt) of the state. “The education system hasn’t caught up with the linguistic richness of the state,” says Das.Yet, paradoxically, Bihar’s reading outcomes have improved: 41.2% of Class 5 students can now read Class 2-level texts. Numbers rise, but the languages dwindle.Here, in the country’s most populous state, Urdu and Sanskrit are taught from classes 5 to 8 in private schools and is mandatory for classes 6 to 8 in govt- and govt-aided inter colleges. In some, govt students can even choose to study Sanskrit till Class 12.Students opting for Sanskrit are limited though. Most tend to regard Sanskrit as merely a subject to clear in exams. Teachers, however, note that Urdu learning is more widespread because of its use in the literary world. “In our college, we have 15 Urdu learners in a class of 40. They come from all communities,” says Mirza Shaﬁq Husain Shafaq, an Urdu teacher in Lucknow. His class sometimes drifts into poetry and shayari.Recruitment of teachers is hard, though. “We get many science and commerce teachers,” says Anil Agarwal of St Joseph Institutions. “But, for Sanskrit or Urdu, barely anyone applies.” According to educators and administrators in UP, the challenge is in recruiting postgraduate teachers for Sanskrit and Urdu, as few opt for higher studies in these languages.Agarwal says continuous professional development through workshops, conferences, and online courses would address the shortage. Mentorship programmes to connect experienced educators with newcomers and collaboration by govt bodies with academic institutions in creating policies, he said, would create a conducive environment for teaching these languages.In Belagavi, the children speak Kannada, Marathi, Urdu — but not Hindi. “It feels out of place,” says award-winningteacher Hema Idagal. “They can’t grasp it because they don’t hear it.”In Mangaluru, efforts to preserve Tulu and Konkani as third languages are an act of devotion, not policy. Tulu is offered in around 40 schools, but Konkani Academy, footing the salary bill, has no formal funding for it. Konkani’s journey is steeper still — just four to ﬁve schools now teach it, mostly in Devanagari.“People ask, why teach what they already speak?” says Joachim Stany Alvares of the academy. “But if English speakers learn English, why not formalise our own?”Even students who love Tulu ﬁnd no continuation in pre-university education, making the choice impractical. “We offer it out of love,” says Dinesh Shettigar, Tulu teacher and drawing instructor, who worries what will happen after his retirement.Here, teaching the third language begins right from Class 1 — at least in policy. Teachers, however, are reeling from the shock. “It was never in the original foundational education plan,” says Mahendra Ganpule, ex-vice president of the State Headmasters’ Association. “Then suddenly we were told it must be taught — but with no extra teachers.”In Marathi-medium schools, English is a challenge; in English-medium schools, it’s Marathi. A third language, usually Hindi, simply compounds the confusion. The state recently made Marathi compulsory across all schools till Class 10. Hindi, initially mandated till Class 5, was made optional after protests.ASER data shows that in 2024, 50.3% of rural students could read a Class 2 text — down from 2018. English reading proﬁciency remains dire: just 12.1% of Class 5 students could read basic sentences in 2022. “Hiring depends on how many students opt for a language,” says Zafar Khan, a headmasters’ association president. “No takers, no teachers.”For a country that prides itself on linguistic diversity, our classrooms echo the opposite. Third languages are a constitutional promise, a pedagogical gift — but, increasingly, an administrative burden, experts say. Prof Madri Kakoti of Lucknow University offers a hopeful note. “Multiple languages don’t just build neural pathways. They connect us to each other. To learn a third language is to increase cultural understanding between our people, expose our children to the traditions of neighbouring states and their people, and encourage a whole new generation towards humanities and literature. ”But, for that to happen, it must ﬁrst be taught with purpose — not as a policy checkbox, but as a bridge between a child’s tongue and the world.In the corner of a school corridor in south Kolkata, a retired Sanskrit teacher quietly takes a class without pay.

As usual politicians are loading their issues onto children. ”In West Bengal, where the State Education Policy was introduced as a counterweight to the Centre’s NEP, the third language begins in Class 5 — if schools can ﬁnd someone to teach it. Hindi or Sanskrit is usually the choice for Classes 7 and 8, or in some cases Urdu, but few institutions allocate full-time teachers for them. So principals improvise.“We employ a retired Sanskrit teacher on an honorary basis and a part-time Hindi teacher,” says Amit Sen Majumder of Jodhpur Park Boys’ School in south Kolkata. However, the pay can be as little as Rs 5,000.Keeping students engaged and convincing parents is equally a daunting task. Anjana Dutta, whose son is in Class 7 at a south Kolkata school, said, “Students are reluctant to study a third language, knowing it’s only for two years. Govt should ensure proper teaching and offer language options that could be useful later.”Incidentally, Bengali is taught compulsorily from Class 1. And while ASER (Annual Status of Education Report) 2024 paints a picture of improvement in the state — 71.3% of Class 8 students can read a Class 2-level text — parents are not entirely impressed with the standards.In Bihar, the formula includes Hindi, English and Sanskrit or Urdu — but again, the approach smacks of lip service. “Some schools have students without teachers; others have teachers without students,” admits ManojKumar, working president, State Primary Teachers’ Association. It’s not surprising, as sanctioned posts for language teachers has not kept pace with increase in students.Retired Patna University teacher and Sahitya Akademi Award winner Arun Kamal points out that studentshere mostly opt for Sanskrit as third language besides Hindi and English. Even as there is a facility for Bengali teaching in some schools, there are very few teachers for the subject. “We don’t offer enough options. There is no imaginative engagement.”Even Maithili, which is spoken in 148assembly constituencies and has been included in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution, is not taught in schools as yet. Linguist Bhairav Lal Das says Maithili is a popular language with a rich history but has not yet been made the medium of instruction even in the Mithilanchal (Maithili belt) of the state. “The education system hasn’t caught up with the linguistic richness of the state,” says Das.Yet, paradoxically, Bihar’s reading outcomes have improved: 41.2% of Class 5 students can now read Class 2-level texts. Numbers rise, but the languages dwindle.H ere, in the country’s most populous state, Urdu and Sanskrit are taught from classes 5 to 8 in private schools and is mandatory for classes 6 to 8 in govt- and govt-aided inter colleges. In some, govt students can even choose to study Sanskrit till Class 12.Students opting for Sanskrit are limited though. Most tend to regard Sanskrit as merely a subject to clear in exams. Teachers, however, note that Urdu learning is more widespread because of its use in the literary world. “In our college, we have 15 Urdu learners in a class of 40. They come from all communities,” says Mirza Shaﬁq Husain Shafaq, an Urdu teacher in Lucknow. His class sometimes drifts into poetry and shayari.Recruitment of teachers is hard, though. “We get many science and commerce teachers,” says Anil Agarwal of St Joseph Institutions. “But, for Sanskrit or Urdu, barely anyone applies.” According to educators and administrators in UP, the challenge is in recruiting postgraduate teachers for Sanskrit and Urdu, as few opt for higher studies in these languages.Agarwal says continuous professional development through workshops, conferences, and online courses would address the shortage. Mentorship programmes to connect experienced educators with newcomers and collaboration by govt bodies with academic institutions in creating policies, he said, would create a conducive environment for teaching these languages.In Belagavi, the children speak Kannada, Marathi, Urdu — but not Hindi. “It feels out of place,” says award-winningteacher Hema Idagal. “They can’t grasp it because they don’t hear it.”In Mangaluru, efforts to preserve Tulu and Konkani as third languages are an act of devotion, not policy. Tulu is offered in around 40 schools, but Konkani Academy, footing the salary bill, has no formal funding for it. Konkani’s journey is steeper still — just four to ﬁve schools now teach it, mostly in Devanagari.“People ask, why teach what they already speak?” says Joachim Stany Alvares of the academy. “But if English speakers learn English, why not formalise our own?”Even students who love Tulu ﬁnd no continuation in pre-university education, making the choice impractical. “We offer it out of love,” says Dinesh Shettigar, Tulu teacher and drawing instructor, who worries what will happen after his retirement.Here, teaching the third language begins right from Class 1 — at least in policy. Teachers, however, are reeling from the shock. “It was never in the original foundational education plan,” says Mahendra Ganpule, ex-vice president of the State Headmasters’ Association. “Then suddenly we were told it must be taught — but with no extra teachers.”In Marathi-medium schools, English is a challenge; in English-medium schools, it’s Marathi. A third language, usually Hindi, simply compounds the confusion. The state recently made Marathi compulsory across all schools till Class 10. Hindi, initially mandated till Class 5, was made optional after protests.ASER data shows that in 2024, 50.3% of rural students could read a Class 2 text — down from 2018. English reading proﬁciency remains dire: just 12.1% of Class 5 students could read basic sentences in 2022. “Hiring depends on how many students opt for a language,” says Zafar Khan, a headmasters’ association president. “No takers, no teachers.”For a country that prides itself on linguistic diversity, our classrooms echo the opposite. Third languages are a constitutional promise, a pedagogical gift — but, increasingly, an administrative burden, experts say. Prof Madri Kakoti of Lucknow University offers a hopeful note. “Multiple languages don’t just build neural pathways. They connect us to each other. To learn a third language is to increase cultural understanding between our people, expose our children to the traditions of neighbouring states and their people, and encourage a whole new generation towards humanities and literature. ”But, for that to happen, it must ﬁrst be taught with purpose — not as a policy checkbox, but as a bridge between a child’s tongue and the world.","The three-language formula of the national education policy (nep) is a muddled mosaic of politics, policy and pedagogy. In practice, the ‘third language’ is often the orphaned child of the curriculum — chronically underfunded, sporadically taught, rarely enjoyed. Urdu and sanskrit are taught from classes 5 to 8 in private schools in bihar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121921548,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2140389,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
