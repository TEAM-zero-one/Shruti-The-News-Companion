Inputs from Shailvee Sharda & Intishab Ali

On returning from college recently, Kolkata-based Anusha (name changed) — a thalassaemia patient who contracted HIV through a blood transfusion a few years ago — read a headline that gave her pause.Two years after 14 children in Uttar Pradesh reportedly contracted HIV and hepatitis after blood transfusions, five children with thalassaemia tested HIV-positive after receiving blood at Jharkhand’s Chaibasa Sadar Hospital last month, with a sixth case emerging at another facility in the state.“At least I can afford treatment,” says Anusha. “Many who visit rural centres and govt hospitals can’t.”Opposition leaders have claimed that six more children in Ranchi and one child in Koderma have been affected.For thalassaemia patients — dependent on lifelong transfusions — the Jharkhand case has reopened an old wound.“We are sick and tired,” says lawyer Anubha Taneja Mukherjee. A thalassaemia patient herself, she is member-secretary of Thalassemia Patients Advocacy Group (TPAG), which has long been seeking a uniform national blood law and mandatory upgrade of screening technologies. “This isn’t just a system failure.It’s a violation of the right to safe, life-saving care.”Initial investigation indicates that the Chaibasa blood bank used fourth-generation ELISA tests, but not nucleic-acid amplification testing (NAAT), which can detect infections during the “window period” when ELISA may fail.Five cases have been traced to this facility, whose licence — according to local media reports — lapsed in 2023. While hospitals often operate under “deemed-continuation” rules during renewal, the case has raised questions about accountability, oversight and quality control.Jharkhand health authorities have suspended senior officers and ordered statewide inspections of blood banks, while the high court has taken suo motu cognizance, asking for data on monitoring, donor-camp protocols, and blood-availability practices.Following statewide inspections, the Jharkhand high court — on Nov 19 — noted that licences of 17 blood banks have been cancelled, and directed the state to set a clear timeline for adopting NAAT for blood screening. The court also found that although the inquiry into the Chaibasa incident is complete, the report has not yet been placed on record.“It’s not an isolated incident,” says Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretarygeneral, People’s Health Organisation (PHO), an NGO known for its work in HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention, and treatment advocacy. “They reflect policy paralysis and administrative collapse.”The tragedy comes even as some states have attempted to build stronger shields around vulnerable patients.In Rajasthan, a health official says the state follows a two-layer protocol for those needing frequent transfusions.“For patients requiring frequent transfusions, we first test by ELISA and then use NAAT to prevent transfusion-transmitted infections,” the official says.“We have been using NAAT for four years.” Rajasthan has begun extending NAAT to general patients in Jaipur and Udaipur, with phased expansion planned across districts still reliant only on ELISA. “NAAT must become universal for high-risk groups,” the official adds.In UP, transfusion oversight is managed by the State Blood Transfusion Council, led by Dr Geeta Agarwal. “No case of contaminated blood transfusion has come to the council’s notice in the past 10 years,” she says, adding that UP follows guidelines and SOPs issued by National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC, the central body that coordinates state blood transfusion councils) and cross-checks compliance.“We reinforce rational use of blood every three weeks across all blood banks, mandate testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C, malaria and syphilis, review data monthly, and conduct quarterly quality assessments.”UP has also created a digital monitoring tool with nearly 200 parameters, she says, adding that the Food and Drug Administration conducts at least one physical inspection a year.This is in stark contrast to the gaps exposed in Jharkhand.India’s fight for safe blood began in the late 1980s, when PHO’s public-interest petition spurred early HIV screening in Maharashtra and Goa. A landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1998 mandated national screening and empowered NACO (National Aids Control Organization, under the ministry of health and family welfare) to overhaul blood banks.The reforms worked: transfusion-linked HIV transmission in formal systems dropped from nearly 10% of infections to under 1%. According to NACO’s 2024 report, there are now 2.5 million Indians living with HIV.“While progress has been made, a blood market exists,” says Dr Sanghamitra Ghosh of the Indian Public Health Association. Informal networks, untrained staff and patchy supervision create unsafe pockets, especially in states with limited resources.Thalassaemics are the most vulnerable as they require regular transfusions. India has one of the world’s largest burdens of thalassaemia: of the 12,000 such patients born each year, nearly half don’t reach adulthood.A 2011-2018 study of 1,087 patients across five Indian centres found mortality up to seven times higher in children under five, with transfusion-transmitted infections significantly increasing risk.Globally, NAAT is a gold-standard test because it detects viruses during the earliest phase of infection. It is, however, expensive and requires trained personnel. ELISA is mandated in India; NAAT is optional: “Why is NAAT testing only mandated in certain hospitals in certain states when it should be available to all?” Anusha asks.This safety gap is particularly dangerous in Jharkhand, where tribals constitute over 26% of the population.Experts, as cited in a media report, note that the prevalence of beta-thalassaemia traits is alarmingly high (11%) in these communities because of genetic clustering, historical malaria prevalence, and intra-community marriages, making the need for advanced screening critical.“What we call technology gaps are also governance and capacity gaps,” says Dr Yazdi Italia, Padma Shri awardee and blood-safety advocate. “Machines are only as good as the people running them.”In June, TPAG convened transfusion experts, policymakers and patient groups in Delhi for a strategic dialogue on strengthening blood safety. The group released a white paper shared exclusively with TOI, noting that India’s blood-safety system remains “complex and fragmented”, with varied practices across states and institutions.“Despite its proven effectiveness, NAAT is not yet mandatory or uniformly implemented across India, especially in govt-run or rural facilities,” the paper states.Mukherjee calls the tragedy a wake-up call. “This is not merely a medical systems issue. It is about dignity, equity and the right to safe care.” Transfusion-medicine specialist Dr Sangeeta Pathak told the forum that safety isn’t only about screening: “Any lapse in the chain — from improper cold storage to outdated transport protocols — can waste units and endanger lives.”She called for real-time coldchain trackers, digitised inventories, and geo-tagged traceability from donor to recipient.Despite progress, a shadow market persists. In some pockets, up to 30% of blood still comes from paid donors, who often use false identities to bypass screening.“The blood market still exists,” says Dr Ghosh. “Donors must be traced in this case — otherwise, the chain of infection will continue.”Most banks test only for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and malaria. Donors aren’t always notified of positive results, enabling repeat donation elsewhere.Atul Gera, called the ‘Blood Man of Jharkhand’, told a media outlet that the only guaranteed way to prevent such incidents is to stop the acceptance of “replacement blood” (where a patient’s family must provide a donor) and mandate reliance solely on voluntary blood donation.Experts argue that universal NAAT is unrealistic for every small centre. Instead, they recommend a hub-andspoke model: centralised high-tech hubs that perform advanced screening, with peripheral centres handling storage and distribution.Countries like Canada and the UK already follow this model. “It removes dependence on local equipment or staffing,” says Dr Italia.India has the science, infrastructure and experience to build a safe transfusion system. What it needs, experts say, is political will and urgency. “We owe the kids in Jharkhand — and every citizen — a system where every drop of blood is safe,” Dr Gilada says.","Five children with thalassaemia tested hiv-positive after receiving blood at jharkhand’s chaibasa sadar hospital last month, with a sixth case emerging at another facility in the state. ‘we are sick and tired,’ says lawyer anubha taneja mukherjee, member-secretary of thalassemia patients advocacy group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125578293,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-370785,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday suggested to the Centre that it bring back the pregnant Sunali Khatun, and five others, including her husband Danish Sekh and their minor son Sabir, who were deported to Bangladesh on grounds of being illegal immigrants, as an interim measure and inquire about their nationality on their return, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The court, however, called for tough measures against infiltrators.Appearing for the deportees, senior advocates Sanjay Hegde, Kapil Sibal and G Sankaranarayanan told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that Sunali, her husband and son have documents to prove citizenship and their deportation violated their fundamental rights. ""They must be brought back as per Calcutta HC's order,"" they said.Hearing the Centre's appeal against the HC order, the bench said, ""Now that certain material, including landholding records and relatives' statements, have come on record, why don't you bring them back and inquire about their nationality? You hardly held any inquiry before deporting them.""As an interim measure, bring them back and hold an inquiry. Examine the documents produced by them or on their behalf and give them a chance to prove their nationality,"" the bench said.However, it accepted that the removal of illegal Bangladeshi migrants from Indian soil is absolutely justified. The bench sought Centre's response to its suggestion on Monday.In its appeal, Centre has challenged the Calcutta high court's Sept 26 order quashing the detention order of June 24 and deportation order of June 26, and directing the home ministry to take all steps to bring back the six persons so deported within four weeks by working in coordination with high commission of India in Dhaka.Centre said that the six people in question had failed to produce any document to substantiate their claim of being Indian citizens or residing legally in India. After their deportation, a missing person/s complaint was filed with West Bengal police and the gram panchayat issued them domicile certificates. Thereafter, HCs of Delhi and Calcutta were petitioned simultaneously, with the petition before Delhi HC being withdrawn without disclosing that another is pending before Calcutta HC.It said the Delhi Police's inquiry had established that the persons concerned were illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. In fact, they themselves had admitted to the fact. The deportation orders were passed after following due procedure, Centre said. ""Since India has open/porous land borders with many countries such as Bangladesh and Myanmar, there is continuous threat of influx of illegal immigrants, and such influx has serious national security ramifications. There is an organised and well-orchestrated influx of illegal immigrants through various agents and touts for monetary considerations,"" Centre argued.","Give deported people chance to prove their nationality: sc.

The reduced strength of the delegation was, however, questioned by national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who asked why EC was scared to face 10 MPs. He even dared EC to telecast the meeting live.Derek, meanwhile, wrote to EC again Tuesday, reiterating the 10 names for the delegation.Interestingly, the 'authorised representatives' of the party - who, as per EC records, are Lok Sabha MPs Abhishek Banerjee and Kakoli Dastidar - do not figure on this list of 10.Sources in EC said as per the rule, only the party president or ""authorised party representatives"" declared to the commission can nominate members of their party's delegation for a meeting with EC.

Explained: How new labour laws could hit your take-home salary, increase your provident fund & gratuity contributions

New Labour Codes: Why will your take home pay go down?

Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages.

and payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the Code on Wages. The new regulation requires that an employee's basic salary must constitute at least 50% of their total CTC, or meet the government-specified percentage.

This adjustment will lead to higher contributions as both PF and gratuity calculations are based on an individual’s basic pay .

. Whilst this change ensures enhanced retirement benefits for workers, it also means reduced take-home pay, as the increased contributions will come from the existing CTC.

The regulation concerning basic salary aims to stop organisations from intentionally maintaining low basic salary whilst increasing allowances to reduce their obligations towards retirement benefits and gratuity.

Currently, PF contributions are set at 12% of the basic salary, whilst gratuity payments are determined by the final basic pay and tenure at an organisation.

New labour Codes: Impact on Take-Home Salary

.

New Labour Codes: Top points to know

.

New labour codes 2025: The government has notified the new labour laws that may require companies to ensure that the basic salary makes up at least 50% of the total cost-to-company (CTC). This could potentially prompt changes in how pay packages are structured. As a result, for many employees, take-home pay could come down over time as contributions to retirement savings are likely to rise.The government has unified 29 labour-related central laws into four extensive Labour Codes: the Code on Wages (2019), Industrial Relations Code (2020), Code on Social Security (2020), and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code (2020). Starting November 21, 2025, these Codes seek to simplify regulatory compliance, enhance worker safeguards, and modernise India's workforce regulations in accordance with contemporary economic conditions.The Code on Wages became operational on Friday, with the government expected to announce detailed rules within the next 45 days. Companies will need to restructure their salary frameworks to comply with these new regulations.According to experts, employees might receive reduced take-home pay under the new rules, as both provident fund and gratuity contributions would increase within the existing CTC framework.""The new labour codes unify the definition of 'wages' under the Code on Wages and Social Security. This would mean better retirement security through higher gratuity and provident fund but a possible dip in take-home pay if employers restructure allowances downward to offset costs,"" Suchita Dutta, executive director of the Indian Staffing Federation was quoted as saying by ET.The standardisation of wage definitions across labour codes ensures uniformity in computing social security benefits.""Wages now include basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance; 50% of the total remuneration (or such percentage as may be notified) shall be added back to compute wages, ensuring consistency in calculating gratuity, pension and social security benefits,"" explains Anjali Malhotra, partner at professional services firm Nangia Group.According to Puneet Gupta, partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, the implementation of labour codes could result in increased gratuity payments since calculations will be based on ""wages"", encompassing basic salary and all allowances, excluding HRA and conveyance allowance.The new labour codes introduce universal minimum wages for all employees across organised and unorganised sectors, replacing the earlier system that covered only about 30% of workers.A statutory floor wage will be set by the government based on minimum living standards, and no state can fix wages below this benchmark.A uniform definition of wages now applies, where basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance together must account for at least 50% of total remuneration.The codes mandate gender equality, prohibiting discrimination in hiring, wages, or employment terms for similar work, along with universal wage payment coverage that ensures timely payments and prevents unauthorised deductions for employees earning up to ₹24,000 per month. Overtime compensation must be paid at twice the normal rate.Several compliance and enforcement reforms are included as well. Decriminalisation of offences replaces imprisonment with monetary penalties for first-time violations, and compounding of offences allows certain fines to be settled without prosecution.The threshold for government approval of lay-offs, retrenchment, or closure has increased from 100 to 300 workers, with states allowed to raise it further.Work-from-home is formally recognised in services sectors based on mutual agreement, while dispute resolution will be handled by two-member tribunals for faster outcomes.A mandatory 14-day strike notice aims to prevent sudden disruptions and includes mass casual leave within the definition of a strike.The codes extend social protections to new categories, requiring aggregators to contribute 1–2% of annual turnover towards gig and platform workers’ social security (capped at 5% of their payments).Fixed-term employees become eligible for gratuity after just one year of continuous service instead of five.The inspector-cum-facilitator system introduces randomised, technology-driven inspections to reduce harassment and improve transparency. Compliance is simplified through digitisation of records, as well as a streamlined one license, one registration, one return system.Employers must issue formal appointment letters detailing job roles, wages, and social security.The codes also expand labour flexibility and reduce burdens on small units.Night shifts for women are permitted in all establishments with their consent and safety measures. Contract labour rules include an all-India licence valid for five years.Factory thresholds have been raised to 20 workers for units using power and 40 for those without, reducing compliance requirements for smaller factories.Finally, working hours remain capped at 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week, with flexible weekly structures allowed through mutual consent.","Mandatory retirement contributions, including provident fund and gratuity payments, are set to rise following the implementation of the code on wages.

'All 140 MLAs Are Mine': DK Shivakumar Amid Karnataka CM Speculation; Siddaramaiah Responds

Mallikarjun Kharge on Karnataka power tussle

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar on Tuesday remarked that he does not want to discuss the CM change issue “publicly,” describing it as a “secret deal” involving “four and five people” in the party.Shivakumar, who also heads the Karnataka Congress, explained that he does not want to cause any “embarrassment” to the grand old party.“I don’t know. I have not asked to be made CM. It is a secret deal between five and six of us. I don’t want to speak publicly on this. I believe in my conscience. We should work with our conscience. I don’t want to embarrass the party or weaken it. If the party is there, we are there. If ‘karyakartas’ are there, we are there,” he told reporters, according to PTI. He was visiting his home constituency, Kanakapura.“The chief minister ( Siddaramaiah ) has spoken. He is a senior leader, an asset for the party. He has completed 7.5 years as CM,” Shivakumar added, referring to Siddaramaiah’s earlier five-year term from 2013–2018.Asked about legislators backing him travelling to Delhi to meet the Congress high command with a demand to make him CM, Shivakumar responded that he was ""unaware"" of it, suggesting they might be making efforts to secure ministerial positions.“I have not telephoned or called any of them (legislators) or spoken to them. I’m not asking them why they went. I don’t need it,” he remarked.A batch of six Congress legislators supporting him had travelled to Delhi on November 23 to meet senior leaders, according to party sources, who added that a few more MLAs are likely to follow soon to push Shivakumar’s case.Last week, around ten legislators backing him had met Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge with the same demand.The power tussle within the ruling party has intensified amid speculation over a leadership change, after the state government reached the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, following talk of a “power-sharing” agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar in 2023.Meanwhile, Kharge, too, maintained that the issue of leadership change in Karnataka is not something to be taken up in public.The veteran leader, in Delhi to attend Constitution Day celebrations on Wednesday, told reporters: “This is not a subject to be discussed here and that too in public. I have specially come to attend an event related to Constitution Day. After the event, I have review meetings, after which I will proceed further.”Siddaramaiah has repeatedly maintained that he will remain chief minister for the full five-year term and will continue to present future state budgets.","Dk shivakumar says he does not want to discuss the cm change issue ""publicly"" karnataka chief minister siddaramaiah has repeatedly maintained that he will remain chief minister for the full five-year term.

West Bengal: CPM loses ground after 3-decade rule





Why Left lost Bengal but not Kerala?





The minority shift

End of CPM's 25-year rule in Tripura



CPM vs CPM



All eyes on Kerala



Left's pro moves in Kerala



The Left in India is confronting one of its most introspective moments in decades. From West Bengal, where the CPM once ran the world’s longest-elected communist government, to Tripura, where a 25-year rule ended abruptly in 2018, the party is grappling with a pattern of shrinking vote shares, organisational drift and confused political messaging. Even Kerala, its last remaining stronghold, is showing signs of strain ahead of the 2026 Assembly election.Kerala now carries the burden of being the Left’s last functioning model. But even there, anti-incumbency pressures, the BJP’s new inroads, and debates around the CPM’s outreach to caste-community organisations and its partnership with big private capital, such as the Vizhinjam port, have raised questions about direction and durability.To understand whether the communists can reinvent themselves, it’s necessary to trace how they lost ground elsewhere, starting with West Bengal, where the unraveling first became unmistakable.The CPIM today occupies only a fraction of the political space it once dominated in West Bengal, a state it governed from 1977 to 2011. Its diminished presence became unmistakable during the 2016 Assembly elections, when the party won just 26 seats—down from 40 in 2011—despite contesting in alliance with the Congress.Even its veteran leader Surjya Kant Mishra lost the Narayangarh seat, which he had held since 1991, underscoring the extent of its organisational decline.A key factor behind this fall was the erosion of trust among the rural population that had powered the Left Front for decades. The party’s early achievements in land reforms, such as Operation Barga, had once strengthened its support base.But later conflicts, notably the police firing in Nandigram in 2007, in which 14 villagers were killed during protests against land acquisition for a chemical hub, reversed much of that goodwill. Similarly, the Singur land acquisition dispute in 2006–08, where many farmers protested the takeover of farmland for the Tata Nano project, created a perception that the party no longer prioritised agrarian interests, and the TMC capitalised on it.Speaking to TOI, when asked if TMC had an edge over CPM when it came to the regional connect, CPM leader Brinda Karat invoked Jyoti Basu's politics saying, ""As far as regional connect is concerned it was the Left led by then chief minister Jyoti Basu who raised the issue of central discrimination against Bengal.""The CPM also struggled with an internal crisis of ideological clarity. While critics had long claimed the Left was too rigid, Bengal’s voters reacted negatively when the party appeared to dilute its ideology. The most prominent example was the 2016 Congress–CPM alliance, which confused sections of its traditional cadre and supporters, who had seen the Congress as the CPM’s principal opponent for decades. The results reflected this discomfort: the CPM’s vote share collapsed to 19.7%, while the Congress increased its seat tally from 42 to 44.A comparison with Kerala highlighted the consequences of these strategic choices. In the same year that the CPM slipped further in Bengal, the party’s Kerala unit refused to ally with the Congress or BJP and maintained a clear ideological line.The result was a decisive victory: the Left Democratic Front won 85 seats, up from 64 in 2011. The contrast suggested that voters respond better when the Left presents a consistent political identity. In West Bengal, the CPM’s decline was driven not only by organisational fatigue but also by policy choices and alliances that contradicted its own political foundations.""Muslims have been an organic part of the communist party in Bengal including among the founders of the party,"" CPM leader and former Rajya Sabha MP Brinda Karat told TOI.In the years when the Left cemented its dominance in Bengal, its leadership ranks were still largely occupied by upper-caste Hindu leaders, the Banerjees, Moitras and Chowdhurys, even in Muslim-majority regions like Malda and Murshidabad. Muslim leaders like Hashim Abdul Halim, Mostafa Bin Kasem and Abdur Rezzak Mollah did establish themselves. But the Left fielded its highest Muslim candidates only in 2011, which is 57.When asked the contrast between inclusion of caste groups in Kerala and Bengal CPM, Karat said: ""Bengal was the most caste ridden society. Communists fought the caste system and succeeded in eliminating the worst untouchability practices that exist in north India . SCs were the forefront right holders under the Left regime. How do you think despite every single barrier the left govt was re-elected six times.""The CPM’s defeat in Tripura in 2018 ended a 25-year run for the Left in one of its strongest bastions and triggered an immediate internal debate on the party’s political direction. The scale of the loss was striking: the BJP, which had less than a 2% vote share in the state earlier, swept to power, while the Left Front collapsed despite securing 46% of the vote. The setback raised questions about the party’s strategy and its ability to read shifting political currents on the ground.The Left in Tripura lost mainly because the BJP built a strong anti-Left wave, captured anti-incumbency sentiment, and successfully mobilised tribal and Congress voters, eroding the Left’s social base and seat share despite a still-high vote share.The Left had relied heavily on tribal support, but the BJP’s alliance with the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura (IPFT) helped it make major inroads among tribal voters, weakening the Left in its strongholds.A major point of contention inside the CPM has been whether the party should build broader alliances to counter the BJP. Leaders aligned with the then general secretary Sitaram Yechury argued that the Left failed to unite anti-BJP votes in Tripura, pointing out that the Congress still had a residual voter base that could have been consolidated. They cited the example of the Congress vote dropping sharply—from 36% to just 2%—much of which shifted to the BJP, suggesting that the absence of a joint front allowed the BJP to make direct gains.The opposing camp, led by former general secretary Prakash Karat, rejected this assessment. They argued that the BJP’s rise was driven mainly by the defection of Congress leaders to the BJP, rather than a failure of alliance-building. Leaders like Brinda Karat noted that the Left remained the largest single vote-getter with 46% and maintained that the Congress had ceased to be a meaningful anti-BJP force. For this faction, the loss reflected anti-incumbency and organisational erosion rather than a strategic error in refusing an understanding with the Congress.Beyond the internal dispute, Left leaders and allies acknowledged a deeper issue: a growing disconnect between the CPM and ground realities in Tripura. The CPI’s D Raja pointed to the party’s inability to “adapt to changing times,” noting that the rise of the BJP-RSS combine required a more flexible strategy. Several insiders admitted privately that while the Left continued to debate alliances at the national level, it failed to recognise the scale of political shifts unfolding in its own stronghold.The CPI(M) goes into the 2026 Kerala Assembly election with several big vulnerabilities. Strong anti-incumbency and governance fatigue have weighed heavily on the Left. After ten years in power, every price rise, job shortage, service gap or corruption allegation is now attributed directly to the ruling government, erasing the benefit of earlier goodwill.The pattern was already visible in recent Lok Sabha elections, where the Left performed poorly even as the Congress gained ground and the BJP made significant inroads into what was once a largely one-party landscape.In both 2019 and 2024 Lok Sabha polls it won very few of Kerala’s 20 seats while the Congress‑led UDF dominated and the BJP opened its account, showing that the Left’s appeal in Parliament elections is weakening even where it still rules the state.In state politics, the CPI(M)-led LDF won the 2021 Assembly election convincingly and achieved a rare second consecutive term, keeping firm control of the Kerala government.Recently critics argued a deliberate effort by CPI(M) to build closer ties with influential Hindu organisations like the Nair Service Society (NSS), SNDP Yogam (Ezhava organisation), and Dalit outfits such as KPMS, often framed as “social engineering” to strengthen support among Hindu castesMoreover, the Vizhinjam port has become a symbol of the Left’s claim to be a “development‑first” force that can deliver big infrastructure while still calling itself socialist. It signals a strategic shift: the CPI(M) is willing to partner with big private capital and take political risks, betting that a successful transshipment hub will shore up its legitimacy as a modern, growth‑oriented Left government.","The left in india is confronting one of its most introspective moments in decades.

Of 16 management quota seats, 4 taken by EWS candidates

Almost 140 candidates from the economically weaker section (annual family income less than Rs 8 lakh) have chosen postgraduate seats in clinical specialties from management and NRI quotas of private medical colleges, for which tuition fees alone range from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore plus per year. This has raised questions about the credibility of EWS certificates.""They apply for PG NEET exam as EWS candidates and when their ranks turn out to be very low, they become NRIs and pay fees in crores or take management quota seats that can also cost more than Rs 1 crore for the entire course. This can happen only in India,"" said a postgraduate trainee doctor. This had happened last year too and yet there was no inquiry by govt into the issue of candidates with fake EWS certificates who affect the chances of deserving candidates, added the doctor.An EWS candidate whose NEET rank was lower than 1.1 lakh has taken an NRI quota seat for MD in dermatology in Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Belagavi, where the annual tuition fees for NRIs are over a crore per annum for this specialty. Another EWS candidate with a rank below 84,000 has opted for an NRI quota seat for MD in general medicine in Vinayaka Missions Medical College in Puducherry, for which the tuition fee is over Rs 55 lakh per year.Three EWS candidate have opted for postgraduate seats in Santosh Medical College in specialties such as radio diagnosis (Rs 76 lakh per year), general medicine and obstetrics and gynaecology, which cost Rs 50 lakh per year. Out of 16 management quota seats for postgraduation in general medicine in Dr DY Patil Medical College in Navi Mumbai, four have been taken by EWS candidates. The tuition fees for this course are Rs 48.5 lakh per annum. An EWS candidate has opted for a seat for MS orthopaedics in the same college, for which the annual tuition fee amounts to Rs 62.5 lakh.The first round of allotment of seats in medical colleges has been completed and the allotment of almost 27,000 candidates has been announced. There are over 52,000 postgraduate seats, which include MD, MS & PG diploma seats, in government and private medical colleges and hospitals. Over 2.4 lakh candidates appeared for NEET PG entrance exam held in Aug and nearly 1.3 lakh qualified.","140 candidates from the economically weaker section (annual family income less than rs 8 lakh) have chosen postgraduate seats in clinical specialties.

NEW DELHI: Twenty-eight Naxalites, including 19 women and 22 cadres carrying a cumulative reward of Rs 89 lakh, surrendered before senior police officers in Chhattisgarh’s Narayanpur district on Tuesday, officials said.According to inspector general of police (Bastar Range) Sundarraj Pattilingam, the group cited their decision was driven by the state government's 'Niyad Nellanar’ (your good village) development initiative, the new surrender-and-rehabilitation policy, and the Bastar police’s “Poona Margham (rehabilitation for social reintegration)” programme.Of those who surrendered, four senior operatives - Pandi Dhruv alias Dinesh (33), a divisional committee member, and Dule Mandavi alias Munni (26), Chhattis Poyam (18) and Padni Oyam (30), all from Military Company No. 6 of the Maoists’ East Bastar division - each carried an Rs 8 lakh reward.Six others, including Lakhmu Usendi (20), Sukmati Nureti (25), Sakila Kashyap (35), Shambatti Shori (35), Chaite alias Rajita (30) and Budhra Rava (28), had bounties of Rs 5 lakh each.Police said that Dinesh, Lakhmu and Sukmati surrendered weapons - a Self Loading Rifle (SLR), an INSAS rifle and a .303 rifle.Pattilingam said the trend reflected a shift on the ground.“The rehabilitation of 28 Maoist cadres in Narayanpur indicates that the end of the violent and anti-people Maoist ideology is near. People are reposing faith in the ‘Poona Margham’ initiative and choosing the path of peace and dignity,” he said. He added that over the last 50 days, more than 512 cadres have joined the mainstream across the Bastar range’s seven districts.Narayanpur SP Robinson Guria said Tuesday’s surrender takes the district’s tally to 287 cadres giving up arms this year. He added that senior Maoist leaders - including politburo member Devji, central committee member Ramdar, and Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee members Pappa Rao and Barse Deva - now have “no option but to renounce violence and join the mainstream.”Police officials said around 2,200 Naxalites, including top operatives, have surrendered in Chhattisgarh over the last 23 months.","Twenty-eight naxalites, including 19 women and 22 cadres, surrendered before senior police officers in chhattisgarh’s narayanpur district on tuesday.

What is urgently required to be done are - timely identification of land and resources for courts, equipping them with essential facilities and expeditious completion of judicial infrastructural projects,"" he said, adding that the emphasis on mediation and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms is expected to lessen the burden on courts in the future.Asked about the growing sense of disappointment among HC judges because of the 'big brother' approach of SC on the judicial side, the CJI said, ""The relationship between HCs and SC is one of constitutional complementarity, not competition. Both institutions serve distinct yet harmonious roles within our federal democracy.""He said the HC's power under Article 225 (jurisdiction of HCs) is in many aspects broader than SC's power under Article 32 (right to constitutional remedies). And, in many instances, SC has asked litigants to first approach HCs for ventilating their grievances, the CJI said. ""The real strength of HCs lies in their proximity to the people. They engage directly with regional realities and local challenges,"" he said.""A vast majority of constitutional matters - right to protection, administrative oversight, executive accountability - continues to be addressed by HCs. This is where I believe the Constitution truly lives in daily practice,"" the CJI said, adding that SC's visibility in certain matters of national importance does not alter this constitutional architecture.","Justice surya kant, known for article 370 ruling and pegasus scrutiny, takes oath as india’s new cji.
