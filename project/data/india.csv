NEW DELHI: Union Cabinet is likely to approve two ropeway projects connecting major pilgrim centres of Hindus and Sikhs — Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib, on Wednesday.The foundation stone for these projects were laid in Oct 2022 under the “Parvatmala Pariyojana”, which aims to boost connectivity in the hilly areas and to boost tourism.Both the projects will be implemented on Build Operate and Transfer. Sources said that while the cost of the 13-km long Sonprayag-Gaurikund-Kedarnath ropeway project was earlier estimated around Rs 1,200 crore and the Govind Ghat-Ghangaria-Hemkund Sahib (12.5 km) project was pegged around Rs 850 crore, these have been revised.The ropeway to Kedarnath would be one of the world’s longest ropeways and would be built at an altitude of 3,583 metres above sea level.Once completed, pilgrims and tourists can reach Kedatnath from Sonprayag in just 60 minutes. Currently, it takes 6-7 hours. The plan envisaged 3,600 passengers could travel in an hour per direction.The 12.5 km proposed ropeway to Hemkund Sahib via Ghangaria will reduce the travel time to about 45 minutes. Ghangaria is the gateway to Valley of Flowers national park. The way from Govind Ghat to Hemkund Sahib is a 19 km steep and tough foot track and takes about 12 hours to reach the shrine.","The foundation stone for these projects were laid in oct 2022 under the “parvatmala pariyojana’ both the projects will be implemented on build operate and transfer.

MUMBAI: Nearly three months after the murder of a sarpanch and revelations about his links with the prime accused, NCP minister Dhananjay Munde on Tuesday resigned from the Maharashtra cabinet citing the dictates of his ""conscience"" and ""health"". Sources said the decision followed an ultimatum from CM Devendra Fadnavis in anticipation of a blowback from the opposition.Munde, who had refused to step down saying he had no involvement in the case, was offered the option to quit or face dismissal, said sources. On Monday evening, Fadnavis and deputy CM and NCP chief Ajit Pawar met Munde and demanded that he quit.It coincided with TV channels and websites running visuals - part of the chargesheet in the Santosh Deshmukh murder case - depicting the brutal manner in which the sarpanch was killed by a gang of extortionists.The resignation was announced by the CM during the budget session, but not in the assembly. Later in a statement, Munde said, ""Seeing the photos that surfaced yesterday, my heart is deeply saddened... Keeping in mind my conscience and as my health has not been good... I have resigned.""At Monday's meeting, Fadnavis said that in the larger interest of the state, it would be better if Munde voluntarily quit, said sources. Pawar endorsed the view, saying he too had faced charges of corruption in 2012. He had then resigned and was back in the cabinet following a preliminary inquiry that exonerated him.BJP minister and Dhananjay's cousin Pankaja Munde said, ""I do not have the courage to watch the video... this is an inhuman act. I apologize to Santosh Deshmukh's mother. My brother should have resigned long back.""Dhananjay links to the murder had surfaced when BJP legislator Suresh Dhas spoke at length about the involvement of Walmik Karad, a trusted aide of the minister.","Dhananjay munde had refused to step down saying he had no involvement in the case.

Kannada actor & DGP's daughter held at Kempegowda International Airport with 14 kg gold in belt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kannada-actor-dgps-daughter-held-at-kempegowda-international-airport-with-14-kg-gold-in-belt/articleshow/118719510.cms,"Photo/Agencies

BENGALURU: Sandalwood actor Ranya Rao , daughter of director general of police (Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao, was arrested by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Monday night, on charges of gold smuggling .Ranya, who had arrived from Dubai , was caught with 14kg of gold bars concealed in a belt strapped to her body, along with 800grams of gold ornaments. She was produced before a judge on Tuesday evening and remanded to 14-day judicial custody. Investigators suspect she is part of a gold smuggling racket that has been actively operating through Bengaluru airport for the past few months.The 32-year-old actress has acted in a few Kannada movies including the Sudeep-starrer Maanikya and Ganesh-starrer Pataki, as well as the Tamil movie Wagah starring Vikram Prabhu.According to sources, Ranya came under DRI's radar due to her frequent foreign trips - reportedly making over 10 trips since the beginning of the year. ""Officials got suspicious and started tracking her multiple short trips to the Gulf,"" an officer posted at KIA said.When she boarded an Emirates flight from Dubai to Bengaluru on Monday, a DRI team was dispatched to intercept her upon arrival. It was shocking to see how she had concealed the gold bars in the belt. She looked very confident when she disembarked and didn't raise any suspicion,"" the source said.The four-member DRI team is reviewing footage of Ranya's recent arrivals in the city. ""In the four previous trips in 15 days, she was dressed similarly, with the belt hidden from view,"" the source said. The DRI is trying to determine whether she smuggled gold on all these occasions and the total quantity brought in.Sources said she evaded detection taking advantage of official protocol services typically used by senior bureaucrats, including IPS officers. ""A protocol officer would meet her at the terminal and escort her out of the building. While her baggage was subject to random and routine checks, she was never physically frisked as she was accompanied by the protocol officer. In fact, a govt vehicle would even pick her up from the airport, ensuring there is no trouble en route home,"" the source explained.When contacted, DGP K Ramachandra Rao distanced himself from his daughter's activities. ""Four months ago Ranya married Jatin Hukkeri (an architect specializing in designing interior spaces for upscale pubs and microbreweries in the city). She hasn't visited us since the wedding. We're completely unaware of her or her husband's business dealings. This has come as a huge shock and disappointment. She has let us down. If there is any violation, the law will take its course,"" Rao told TOI.In 2014, when Rao was IGP (Southern Range), Mysuru police came under scrutiny when a Kerala-based jeweller accused them of pocketing Rs 2 crore. On Jan 4 that year, a police team intercepted a private bus at Mysuru border and seized Rs 2.2 crore in cash being transported to Kerala. However, when registering the case, cops declared only Rs 20 lakh as the unaccounted money. The CID later investigated the case and arrested Rao's gunman for dacoity.","Sandalwood actor ranya rao was arrested by directorate of revenue intelligence (dri) sleuths at the kempegowda international airport (kia) on monday night.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday directed states to devise a policy to prevent private hospitals from fleecing patients by forcing them to buy medicines, implants and consumables from their pharmacies at inflated prices. The court, however, said such policy decisions shouldn't become a deterrent for private entities wanting to enter the healthcare sector.Disposing of a seven-year-old PIL seeking directions to states to prevent private hos-pitals from forcing patients/attendants to buy medicines and other equipment from the hospital or hospital-run pharmacy, a bench of justices Surya Kant and N K Singh said the issue needed states to devise the policy, and it was not advisable for court to micro-manage private hospitals through a judicial order.SC observed that people preferring private hospitals for luxurious stay can't complain of fleecing as they chose not to go to a govt hospital.It is like staying in a five-star hotel and demanding you be allowed to bring food from a streetside dhaba,"" Justice Kant said in a lighter vein. ""You go to AIIMS in Delhi and you will know how dedicated and hard-working doctors are even as the institute provides the best possible treatment to patients irrespective of their status,"" he said.The bench said given the size of the population, states have not been able to create requisite healthcare facilities to cater to the needs of growing numbers of patients. ""States have facilitated private entities to invest in the healthcare sector and some of the private hospitals have created a name in providing specialised treatment,"" it said ""Will it be prudent for govts to introduce policy frameworks to regulate every activity in private hospitals? Will such a policy discourage private entities from investing in the sector?"" the bench asked.","Supreme court asks states to devise a policy to prevent private hospitals from fleecing patients.

India sends request to US seeking crucial info in Rs 64 crore Bofors case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-sends-request-to-us-seeking-crucial-info-in-rs-64-crore-bofors-case/articleshow/118719270.cms,"Bofors scam was a big factor in Rajiv Gandhi’s defeat in the 1989 elections.

Role of Q in Bofors: Questions still linger

NEW DELHI: India has sent a judicial request to the United States, seeking crucial information in connection with the Rs 64-crore Bofors case , potentially marking the revival of the probe into the scandal related to the purchase of 155mm field artillery guns from Sweden under the Congress govt led by Rajiv Gandhi in the late 1980s.The Central Bureau of Investigation sent a letter rogatory, issued by a special court, to the US justice department a few days ago, sources told TOI. The agency has sought case details which Michael Hershman, the head of US-based private detective firm Fairfax, had regarding the kickbacks that Swedish arms manufacturer A B Bofors allegedly paid to bag the order for 400 howitzers from India.In 2017, Hershman had claimed that then PM Rajiv Gandhi was ""furious"" when he had found a Swiss bank account 'Mont Blanc', where the bribe money from Bofors had allegedly been parked. Hershman had also claimed that the then govt had sabotaged his probe.The agency had first approached the court in Delhi in October, informing it about their plan to seek details from the US authorities. The move was prompted by Hershman, who shot into prominence in political circles because of his involvement with the Bofors case, agreeing to cooperate with Indian agencies.A letter rogatory is a formal, written request issued by a court in one country to a court in another country, seeking assistance in gathering evidence or facilitating the probe and prosecution of a criminal case.The Bofors scam, exposed by Swedish radio, was a big factor in Rajiv Gandhi's defeat in the 1989 elections. Although the Delhi high court quashed the bribery charge against the former PM in 2004, questions related to the scam have lingered. These concern the role of Ottavio Quattrocchi, an Italian businessman who enjoyed formidable clout under the Rajiv Gandhi govt, in the bribery affair, and who was allowed to leave the country for Malaysia when he was under investigation, as well as a letter Madhavsinh Solanki, foreign minister in the then Congress govt, had delivered in 1992 to his Swiss counterpart, asking him to go slow on New Delhi's request for information on the case.The attention on Quattrocchi - who had a remarkably successful run as the representative of Italian fertiliser giant Snamprogetti - was renewed when the UPA govt decided not to contest the release of millions of dollars that the alleged middleman had in one of his bank accounts in the UK. In 1987, the Swedish public broadcaster had stunned India and Sweden alike by disclosing payment of bribes in the Howitzer deal.CBI had registered the case in 1990 and later filed chargesheets in 1999 and 2000. After discharging Rajiv Gandhi, a special court dropped all charges against the remaining accused, including the Hinduja brothers. Quattrocchi was discharged in 2011 when a court allowed the CBI's prayer to withdraw prosecution against him.",Bofors scam was a big factor in rajiv gandhi’s defeat in the 1989 elections.

Panchdeep Minar will also dwarf Shahid Minar on the Maidan, which is 48m tall.Designed by IIEST Shibpur, the tower is developed by a private group and overseen by Howrah Municipal Corporation .The observatory deck, situated at a height of 112m, has a floor area of 200sq m (over 2,000sq ft) and can accommodate 200 visitors at a time. The deck will feature four high-powered telescopes with a range of up to 20km, offering clear views of large parts of Kolkata, New Town, Salt Lake and the Kolkata airport, as well as parts of Hooghly and urban and rural Howrah.A 150-seater, 200sq m revolving restaurant is situated below the top viewing deck, at a height of 104m. Below it is an equally large banquet, situated at 108m.The tower has two more decks, one at a height of 50m and the other at 25m.Two high-speed elevators, which travel at 3m per second — each with a capacity of 15 people — will ferry visitors to the decks, the restaurant and the banquet.According to engineer Ram Ratan Chowdhary, director of Panchdeep Constructions, which built the tower, its foundation is 35m — more than 10 storeys deep — with 169 pilings, to make it earthquake-resistant. The diameter of the tower at the plinth level is 40m, while the top deck has a diameter of 22m. The diameter of the bottom shaft is 12m. Around 1,400 tonnes of steel has been used in its construction.Sujay Chakraborty, who chairs Howrah Municipal Corporation's board of administration, said the tower would ""elevate Howrah's status nationally"".The corporation's engineering department will maintain regular oversight. Chakraborty anticipates it becoming a significant attraction for visitors from Howrah, Kolkata and even from elsewhere in the country.Arup Roy, Central Howrah's MLA and a state minister, in whose constituency the tower is located, said, ""Its foundation stone was laid in 2015.

Legal battle and mercy pleas

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Monday said United Arab Emirates (UAE) officially informed the Indian Embassy on February 28 that ""the sentence of Shahzadi has been carried out in accordance with local laws.""The ministry added that the UAE's highest judicial authority, the Court of Cassation, upheld the death sentence, and all legal appeals and mercy petitions failed to overturn the ruling.Earlier today, MEA told the Delhi high court that Indian national, Shahzadi Khan , was executed in (UAE) on February 15, 2025, after being convicted of murdering an infant under her care.""An Indian national, Shahzadi, was convicted on charges of murder of an infant and sentenced to death in the UAE. The highest court of the UAE, the Court of Cassation, upheld the sentence. The Embassy provided all possible legal assistance to Shahzadi, including sending mercy petitions and pardon requests to the government of the UAE. The UAE authorities intimated to the Embassy on February 28, 2025 that the sentence of Shahzadi has been carried out in accordance with local laws. The family of Shahzadi has been informed of the matter,"" MEA said later in the day.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, representing the MEA, informed the Delhi high court about Shahzadi's execution. He also said that the Indian government was providing support to her family, and her cremation is scheduled for March 5.The heartbroken father, Shabbir said that his daughter was not given justice. ""She was not given justice. I tried my best. I have been trying since last year. I don't have enough money to go there (Abu Dhabi) and hire a lawyer. Government did not support us,"" he said.Shabbir Khan had approached the Delhi high court, urging the MEA to intervene in his daughter's case and seek clarity on her legal status. However, with confirmation of her execution, the court disposed of his plea.Shahzadi, a 33-year-old woman from Banda district in Uttar Pradesh, had been working in Abu Dhabi since December 2021 as a caregiver for an Emirati family. The case stemmed from the death of an infant under her care in December 2022, allegedly following routine vaccinations. Initially, the child's parents waived further investigation, but in February 2023, a video surfaced allegedly showing Shahzadi confessing to the murder, a confession her family claimed was obtained through coercion.She was arrested on February 10, 2023, and sentenced to death on July 31, 2023. Her appeals were dismissed, and the death sentence was reaffirmed by the Court of Cassation on February 28, 2024.Shahzadi's family contested the conviction, alleging that she was forced into confessing and denied fair representation. Despite legal assistance provided by the Indian Embassy, her clemency plea faced significant hurdles. Her father, Shabbir Khan, submitted multiple petitions, including one to the Indian Embassy in May 2024, but received no favourable response.On February 14, 2025, Shahzadi reportedly made a distress call to her father, hinting at her imminent execution. Desperate, Shabbir filed an urgent plea with the MEA on February 20, seeking an update on her legal status. However, before any intervention could be secured, the execution was carried out.MEA officials assured that they are extending all necessary assistance to the family, and Shahzadi's last rites are set for March 5. The Indian Embassy has also provided a dedicated contact number for the family to coordinate further arrangements.","Father's plea ends in tragedy for shahzadi khan, convicted of murdering an infant under her care.

KANPUR: The phone rang in a small home in Goyera Mughli village of Banda in UP's Bundelkhand. It was February 15. A voice - familiar yet carrying the weight of impending finality - broke the silence. ""This is my last call,"" said Shahzadi Khan , 33.A hush fell over her family. Her brother Shamsher gripped the phone tighter. ""They asked me about my final wish,"" she said, further adding, ""I asked to speak to ammi and abbu.""Her mother gasped in the background, reaching for a daughter who was facing execution after being convicted of murdering a four-month-old child thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi - too far to hold, too close to lose. And then, silence. Shahzadi was gone.""We did not hear from her afterward,"" Shamsher said Monday. They searched. They begged for news, combing through bureaucratic barriers, unanswered pleas. ""We filed a writ petition in Delhi high court, where we were informed Monday about her execution,"" the brother said.Executed on February 15 - the same day she made her last call. No one knew how. No one knew where her remains lay. Only that it was over. ""Her last rites will be held on March 5,"" additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma said in court.She had left India in search of healing. ""Shahzadi had childhood burn scars on her face,"" said her brother. The scars had always made her self-conscious. ""She wanted to have them removed,"" Shamsher said. When a man named Uzair from Agra reached out on social media, promising help - a chance for plastic surgery in UAE - she dared to dream.She reached Abu Dhabi in Dec 2021 on a legal visa. Upon arrival, Uzair sent her to the home of his relative Faiz, where she was kept as a domestic worker. No surgery, no transformation - only labour and confinement in an unfamiliar world.In Aug 2022, Faiz's wife gave birth to a son and Shahzadi was assigned as the baby's caregiver. Four months later, on Dec 7, the child received routine vaccinations. By nightfall, he was gone.Fazi's grief turned to fury. Shahzadi was accused of killing the infant. She was handed over to Abu Dhabi police on Feb 10, 2023, and was sentenced to death on July 31. She remained in Al Wathba prison until her execution.Her father Shabbir Khan fought relentlessly, sending pleas to anyone who would listen - letters to the President, appeals to the PM. But the clock ran faster than justice. Shamsher demanded his sister's body for a dignified burial at their ancestral home and called for an independent probe, considering their FIR against Uzair for human trafficking ""Uzair deceived my sister with false promises, taking Rs 3 lakh in cash and jewellery from her while also collecting the same amount from his UAE relative to provide them with a maid,"" he said. ""She was a victim, not a criminal. She was innocent,"" Shamsher said. ""She only wanted to fix her scars."" But what of the deeper scars - the ones left behind?",Shahzadi khan was convicted of murdering a four-month-old child in abu dhabi. The 33-year-old was sentenced to death and executed on february 15.

This comes in the backdrop of recommendations of an advisory committee set up by the ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) which in its recent report suggested that “exemplary penalties” should be enforced for proven cases of proxy leadership by husbands and other male relatives in place of elected women ‘pradhans’.The committee had also suggested a detailed roadmap on the way forward with interventions ranging from behavioural change through capacity-building and mentorship and a monitoring framework from the grassroots to the top.At the launch of the campaign on Tuesday, Union minister for Panchayati Raj, Rajiv Ranjan Singh, Union minister for women and child development Annapurna Devi and minister of state for Panchayati Raj S P Singh Baghel spoke strongly against proxy leadership in panchayats often in the garb of ‘MP’ (Mukhiya Pati), ‘SP’ (Sarpanch Pati) and ‘PP’ (Pradhan Pati).Minister of state for youth affairs and sports Raksha Nikhil Khadse, who began her political journey as a sarpanch of a gram panchayat in Maharashtra encouraged women leaders to lead with confidence to counter patriarchy and proxy leadership.Meanwhile, the primer on laws is seen as a critical component aimed at equipping women leaders with legal knowledge during training on concerns related to gender based violence. From touching upon concepts like ""consent"" as defined in law to dwelling on the definition of domestic violence and workplace harassment - the training manual ensures elected representatives are equipped with not just the legal knowledge but also the process to help women in distress.The primer has dedicated chapters on legal provisions available to report domestic violence, child abuse, child marriage, gender biased sex selection, workplace harassment, trafficking and technology facilitated gender-based violence that dwells on concerns like online sexual harassment, cyberstalking, image based abuse, impersonation and hacking.","The centre moved to curb the "" sarpanch pati "" phenomenon with the launch of a first-of-its-kind capacity building programme.

Government's Project Lion

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , on the occasion of the World Wildlife Day , went on a lion safari at Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat's Junagadh district on Monday.PM Modi, who is on the Gujarat tour, visited the forest with some ministers and senior forest department officials accompanying him.Modi had a night halt at Sinh Sadan, a forest guest house managed by the state forest department, in Sasan after his arrival from Somnath where he offered prayers at the Lord Shiv temple, the first among 12 jyotirlingas, on Sunday evening.At Sasan Gir , the headquarters of the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, the prime minister will also chair the seventh meeting of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL).After the meeting, Modi will also interact with some women forest staffers at Sasan.The NBWL has 47 members, including the Chief of Army Staff, members from different states, representatives from NGOs working in this field, chief wildlife wardens and secretaries from various states.""This morning, on World Wildlife Day, I went on a Safari in Gir, which, as we all know, is home to the majestic Asiatic Lion. Coming to Gir also brings back many memories of the work we collectively did when I was serving as Gujarat CM. In the last many years, collective efforts have ensured that the population of Asiatic Lions is rising steadily. Equally commendable is the role of tribal communities and women from surrounding areas in preserving the habitat of the Asiatic Lion ,"" PM Modi wrote on X.The Prime Minister also shared the photos he clicked during the safari. ""Lions and lionesses in Gir! Tried my hand at some photography this morning,"" PM Modi wrote on X.Project Lion is an initiative launched by the central government on August 15, 2020, aimed at conserving and expanding the population of Asiatic lions in Gujarat.With a 10-year plan and a budget of Rs 2,927.71 crore, the project focuses on various strategies, including habitat and population management, wildlife health, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, community participation, tourism development, scientific research, training, eco-development, and biodiversity conservation.As of 2020, the Asiatic lion population in Gujarat was estimated at 674 individuals, spread across 53 talukas in 9 districts, covering nearly 30,000 square kilometers. A significant aspect of Project Lion is the development of the Barda Wildlife Sanctuary as a 'second home' for lions. Due to natural spread and successful breeding, Barda now hosts 17 lions, including 6 adults and 11 cubs.Additionally, a National Referral Center for Wildlife Health has been approved, with 20.24 hectares of land allocated in New Pipaliya, Junagadh District. A high-tech monitoring center and a state-of-the-art veterinary hospital have also been established in Sasan to monitor wildlife in the Gir region.Project Lion represents a transformative effort in India's conservation journey, aiming to ensure the long-term survival and well-being of Asiatic lions through comprehensive strategies and community involvement.","Prime minister narendra modi went on a lion safari at gir wildlife sanctuary in gujarat's junagadh district.

GUWAHATI: Assam health minister Ashok Singhal 's alleged remarks against "" Miyas "" triggered uproar and disruption in Assam assembly Tuesday, with Badruddin Ajmal-led AIUDF seeking a breach of privilege motion against him. AIUDF accused the BJP minister of inciting communal divisions and hatred.In Assam, Miya is a euphemism, used disparagingly to refer to Bengali-speaking immigrant Muslims of Bangladeshi origin - a community of over one crore people, and central to the state's anti-foreigner agitation of the 1980s.The controversy erupted after Singhal allegedly said at a meeting in his constituency - Dhekiajuli, an area with a large population of immigrant Muslims - that Miyas should not be allowed to operate shops during Hindu festivals .Singhal allegedly said he had ""zero support"" for them and urged people to side with him for his cooperation, while discouraging interactions between communities. A video circulating online also shows him saying, ""Don't give it (shops) to Miyas. Give it to our youths. How can Miyas enter our festival? Our boys do not enter in Eid... I am not with them. If you mingle with them, I am not with you.""AIUDF MLA Rafiqul Islam, who attempted to move the privilege motion, accused Singhal of violating his oath by showing bias. ""He cannot continue as minister,"" Islam said, questioning if Singhal would also withdraw doctors from Miya-inhabited areas. However, the Speaker disallowed the motion, stating it didn't meet the criteria.Islam warned that Singhal's comments could lead to discrimination against the community in government schemes.","Assam health minister ashok singhal's alleged remarks against "" miyas "" triggered uproar and disruption in assam assembly tuesday.

Duplicate EPIC numbers: Do they pose threat to fair polls?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/duplicate-epic-numbers-do-they-pose-threat-to-fair-polls/articleshow/118718992.cms,"<p>Duplicate EPIC numbers: Do they pose threat to fair polls?<br></p>

What is EPIC?

Why then the duplicity in EPIC numbers?

Can two electors having the same EPIC number vote interchangeably?

Was the duplicity in EPIC numbers raised earlier?

What next?

Duplicity in some electors photo identity card (EPIC) numbers issued in parts the country - recently flagged by TMC - has become a bone of contention, with Trinamool and Congress even alleging a conspiracy to introduce fake voters . TOI takes a deep dive to investigate how duplicate EPIC numbers came about and whether it is possible for two electors with the same EPIC number to vote interchangeably.EPIC, introduced in 1993, is an identification document issued to each elector after he is enrolled in the voter's list. EPIC is issued based on details included in the photo electoral roll (introduced in 2005) like the elector's name, photo, name and number of assembly constituency and the the polling booth where an elector is eligible to vote by virtue of being ordinarily resident. Entries on EPIC include the elector's name, father's or husband's name, gender, date of birth, address, assembly constituency number and name. Thus, the elector can only vote in the assembly constituency mentioned on his EPIC card.According to the Election Commission (EC), the allotment of identical EPIC number of series to some electors from different states or Union Territories was due to the decentralised and manual mechanism which was followed before the electoral roll database was shifted to the ERONET platform in 2017. Chief electoral officers of certain states/UTs possibly used the same EPIC alphanumeric series - either inadvertently or due to lack of due diligence required by EC guidelines- creating a scope for duplicate EPIC numbers being allotted to electors in different assembly constituencies of different states/UTs.No. When an elector wants to vote, he usually carries EPIC for identification. However, EPIC is not mandatory for voting. 11 alternative documents - like Aadhaar, PAN no., driving licence, passport etc - are also accepted for voter identification. The key to voting at a given polling booth in a given assembly constituency, is being enrolled in the voters' list relevant to that polling booth and AC. So, it is the AC, not the EPIC number, which is relevant for eligibility to vote . For instance, a person registered as a voter, say, in a polling booth of Bengal, even if he has the same EPIC number as another voter in a different polling booth or assembly constituency or state/UT, can vote only at his polling booth in Bengal.Each year, nationwide electoral roll revision is taken up and draft rolls shared with political parties for filing claims and objections. No voter can be added, deleted or shown as shifted in the rolls, without filling up the relevant statutory form for the purpose. The electoral registration officer (ERO), usually the block development officer appointed by the concerned state/UT govt, approves the requests made through these forms. Parties, being stakeholders in roll updation, can file appeals against additions and deletions okayed by ERO, first with the district election officer and then, the chief electoral officer, whose word is final.""The parties did not flag the duplicate EPIC numbers during the latest window for filing claims and objections to draft rolls with Jan 1, 2025 as the qualifying date,"" an EC official said.EC, in a statement Sunday, said it would rectify cases of duplicate EPIC numbers and ensure allotment of unique EPIC number to each registered elector. New guidelines in this regard will be issued soon and ERONET 2.0 platform updated to aid and assist in the process. This may require some time, an EC functionary said while holding out the assurance that duplicity in EPIC number ""in no way implies fake voters or undermines one's right to vote"".","Epic, introduced in 1993, is an identification document issued to each elector after he is enrolled in the voter's list.

The Tibetan gully boys who have found a new groove,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-tibetan-gully-boys-who-have-found-a-new-groove/articleshow/118719131.cms,"NEW BEAT: Music has helped rapper T-Nammy overcome substance abuse. (Right) K Kush and G-Tashi’s verses draw heavily on Tibetan culture and the angst of exile

Tibetan music used to be unmistakable - think guttural chants of Buddhist monks, and healing bowls and bells set to the rock and reggae anthems of the '90s that tapped into sentiments of Tibetan refugees to unite and fight for independence. It was a window into their relationships and traditions in exile.So, when G-Tashi , 32, born in a refugee settlement in Karwar, Karnataka; K Kush , born Tenzin Kulsang in McLeod Ganj; and Tenzin Namsel , 27, better known as T-Nammy, from Delhi's Tibetan colony Majnu Ka Tilla decided to flip the script, few took their bedroom raps seriously. They took the unconventional route of dropping their impromptu freeverses on YouTube with its laidback swagger, and gritty hooks and riffs often paired with low-budget videos shot in deserted alleys, bedrooms, atop cars, in under-construction buildings - classic hip-hop territory - and their persistence and potent voice are paying off.Rap seems to come naturally to Tibetans. G-Tashi says Tibetan Buddhist chants often sync perfectly with rap beats ""due to their repetitive and structured use of mantras and phrases."" T-Nammy agrees, recalling a Swiss artist who had remarked on the similarity. ""It made sense to me because it takes a lot of practice for monks to recite those prayers quickly, much like mastering a rap flow. Even though there wasn't a beat back then, the rhythm was already there.""This fresh wave of Tibetan musicians still sings about the ache of 1959 and their need to connect with a homeland they've never seen, drawing from the struggles of their parents and grandparents who had fled Tibet during the Chinese invasion and followed the 14th Dalai Lama into India's capital-in-exile for the Tibetan diaspora, Dharamshala. But they're also pushing beyond nostalgia to build a new narrative for their community using the raw, unfiltered world of hip-hop - on why Indians shouldn't lump Tibetans with the Northeast, their desire for connection, and even about 'tasampa', a traditional Tibetan food made from roasted barley flour.When 19-year-old Tenzin Younten from Darjeeling spotted two Tibetans conversing in Nepali, he knew he had to do something. ""Seeing them speak another language made me want to preserve our own,"" Younten told Radio Free Asia last year. It fuelled him to write 'Speak in Tibetan if you are Tibetan,' a rap aimed at rallying young Tibetans in exile to embrace their native tongue. Today, Younten - whose stage name is Youns BoB - has a YouTube following running into 15,000.G-Tashi's 'Can You Hear Me?' has racked up over two lakh views. He usually raps about the ""dilemma with oneself as an artist, life as Tibetan youth in the hill towns and the unity we share."" T-Nammy, who was raised in a modest home made of plastic sheets and wooden planks and counts American rapper-activist Tupac Shakur as his idol, recalls his uncle's CD shop as his ""gateway to music."" His song 'Letter to God,' with over 40,000 views, is an emotional response to a period of repeated rejections from international shows, a break-in that robbed him of his music equipment and a personal crisis that led to emotional conversations with his father.""I used to be caught up in a destructive lifestyle - weed, alcohol, wasting family money... Music became my anchor, gave me a sense of purpose. Seeing the impact my music was having on other young folks made me clean up my act,"" he says. As he matured, T-Nammy's music embraced the intangible reality of his ancestral land. ""Even though I've never set foot in Tibet, I need no reason to love my country,"" says the 27-year-old who uses their traditional flute (gyaling) and guitar (sgra-snyan) in his music as his way ""to honour this deep-seated connection and cultural pride.""G-Tashi, too, reflects on how the idea of 'home' shapes his music. ""It touches on themes of exile and Tibetan identity. The collab with Kush is about my 'D-Town,' a nod to Dhasha, short for Dharamshala. We also reference the year 1959 with the line 'nyapchu nga gu nantso sempa nangla,' meaning '59 in our heart'."" K Kush, who traces his ancestry to Tibet's Kham region, channels this heritage into his groove-heavy verses and uses traditional Tibetan instruments like the dra-nyen and piwang with modern sounds. ""To keep our culture relatable to younger Tibetans,"" he explains.Being young and Tibetan in India can be complex. ""Sometimes, my Indianness overshadows my Tibetan-ness, which isn't always a bad thing. But I have to remind myself of the responsibility I carry as a Tibetan in exile to pass on what I've inherited,"" says G-Tashi. Passionate about keeping his culture alive, he has been integrating Tibetan lullabies his father sang to him into his music. ""There's more to us than the image of chanting 'Om mani padme hum.' It's not about deliberately breaking stereotypes, but proving that Tibetan music is diverse and evolving.""Their music is on all major streaming platforms. They perform for Tibetan audiences around Dharamsala, Delhi, and at cafes and clubs in Tibetan settlements across India, as well as concerts organised by Tibetan NGOs abroad, especially during Losar, the Tibetan New Year (Feb 28-March 2). ""We hope our listeners walk away with a sense of self-love, positivity and deeper connection to our unique heritage and lost homeland,"" says K Kush.","Tibetan music used to be unmistakable - think guttural chants of buddhist monks, and healing bowls and bells set to the rock and reggae anthems of the '90s. New wave of tibetan musicians still sings about the ache of 1959 and their need to connect with a homeland they've never seen.
