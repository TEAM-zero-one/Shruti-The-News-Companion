NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday opened two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban and three gates at the Salal Dam in Reasi.This reportedly aimed at managing rising water levels triggered by heavy rainfall in the region and also to manage dam pressure.The development comes just days after the Chenab's water levels had dropped sharply, following the government's decision to restrict the river’s flow, an unprecedented action that led to stretches of the riverbed becoming walkable for the first time in recent memory in some downstream areas.The regulation of the Chenab’s flow is being widely viewed as a strategic signal of India’s ability to control water releases, especially in the context of mounting tensions with Pakistan.The decision to restrict the river’s flow followed the Centre’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, announced in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians, including several tourists.Under the IWT, India is obligated to notify Pakistan before making any significant interventions in the flow of western rivers like the Chenab.However, with the treaty now suspended, India has acted unilaterally to manage the river's waters, both in terms of withholding and releasing them as per domestic needs.",Central government opens two gates at the baglihar hydroelectric power project in ramban.

JAISALMER: Peace was what I wanted to pray for when I was looking to join my family Thursday at Chundhi GaneshTemple, 12km from Jaisalmer. Not long after that, though, I was caught in a crossfire - of blasts, gunfire and chaos. Anything but peace.That was how the evening unfolded for me in this Rajasthan border city, engulfed in terror of Pakistani drone attacks near the high-security Pokhran area.My family was already at the temple, having gone there around 7pm. I set out to join them later and had just reached Hanuman Chowk, some distance from my home, around 9pm when I was halted by a hail of deafening blasts overhead, followed by the unmistakable rat-a-tat of gunfire. I pulled over and looked skyward, my heart pounding as multiple explosions shattered the air. Our anti-drone defence systems sprang into action, their rapid fire piercing the darkness as they attempted to neutralise the threats.My thoughts turned to my family. Matters got worse as I learned my son Harshad was on a bus to Jaipur, now caught in the middle of the crisis.Word about the drones spread like wildfire. So did panic. Youths took positions at major intersections, forcing vehicles to turn off lights and threatening those who didn't comply with sticks. Their actions, though aggressive, were driven by the need to protect the city from Pakistani projectiles. The next few hours were frenetic. My family left for home but faced renewed drone attacks around 10pm. This forced them to take shelter at Amarsagar Jain Temple.Heavy rain added to their ordeal. When they tried to return again, they were stopped by police at Moomal Chowk, on the outskirts. This was a frustrating, but necessary, security drill. They later made their way to a restaurant where they waited till 1am (Friday) till it was safe to cover the rest of the way home.In the meantime, I had my son get off the bus at Khetolai, 80km from Jaisalmer, and organised overnight accommodation for him in a village. It wasn't until 2am that my family made it home in Jaisalmer.As a journalist, I am battle-hardened, having covered many challenging situations. But Thursday offered a reality check. My own family was in peril. The Pakistani fusillade has left me deeply shaken. This night will remain etched in memory.","My family was already at the temple, having gone there around 7pm.

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Thirukkural

Kural

Kural

Tirthankara

Why did Valluvar place this couplet ninth in the sequence?

Aadhi Bhagavan – the primordial one

Vaalarivan – The one of flawless wisdom

Malarmisai Eginan – The one whose feet rest upon the flower

Vendudal Vendaamai Ilaan – The one beyond desire and aversion

Iraivan – the sovereign being

Pori Vaayil Aindhu Aviththaan – The one who mastered the five senses

Thanakku Uvamai Illadhaan – None can be compared to Him

Ara Azhi Andhanan – Ocean of virtue and justice

""Kolil pori-yir gunam ilave enn gunaththaan

Thaalai vanangaa thalai.""

Palsied and pointless is the head

That bows not to the One of Eight-Fold Grace.

In the opening chapter of the introductory section of the, Valluvar performs a rare literary feat—dedicating ten couplets solely to exalting the Divine, never revealing—even faintly—his own religious affiliation.The God he praises is cloaked in universality. His words, though deeply reverent, are so free of sectarian markers that the divine he invokes could be an embodiment of virtues. Over the centuries, commentators have drawn from the wells of Saiva Siddhantha, Vaishnavism, Jainism, Buddhism, the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, and even Zoroastrianism to interpret these verses.Yet, the ambiguity has ignited a literary debate among Tamil scholars: Who was Valluvar? What was his faith ?Thiru V Kalyanasundaranar and Vayapuri Pillai, both erudite scholars, suggest that the spiritual overtones of the first chapter hint at Jain influences. On the other hand, Thiru Vajravel Mudhaliyar sees the soul ofsteeped in Saiva Siddhanta. Christian missionary-scholar G U Pope declared that theechoed the Sermon on the Mount. Opinions differ, but there is near-universal agreement on one point: Valluvar wrote for the universal human—unbound by religious identity , yet deeply spiritual.The most debated verse in this opening chapter is the ninth couplet, where God is described as ‘the One who possesses the Eight-Fold Excellence’.Curiously, Valluvar does not elaborate on what these eight attributes are. Perhaps, in his time, they needed no clarification. Or he left it open, inviting seekers to look within and interpret for themselves.Saiva Siddhanta describes the eight traits as supreme grace, omnipotence, incomparability, pure intelligence, omniscience, detachment, infinite bliss, and absolute purity.Jainism, meanwhile, speaks of the eight divine signs that adorn a, the enlightened guide—divine seat, halo, celestial fan, triple umbrella, Ashoka tree, floral rain, heavenly music, and divine proclamation. Jain philosophy also speaks of eight karmic bonds from which the soul must liberate itself—karmas that obscure knowledge, perception, obstruct effort, create delusion, determine body, status, emotion, and lifespan.Some scholars who consider Valluvar as a Siddhar, attribute the couplet to the eight supernatural faculties associated with enlightenment.Amidst this swirl of interpretations, a quiet yet profound insight was once offered by a teacher of mine. She asked:I had no answer.She smiled and said, “Look at the first eight couplets. Each one praises the Divine with a unique attribute. The ninth simply gathers them all—referring to God as the One who embodies these eight virtues already described.”A moment of revelation. Simple, yet powerful.Indeed, the preceding eight couplets refer to God in eight exalted ways:Then comes the ninth, the verse that sparked centuries of debate:What a line—soft in its cadence, sharp in its implication.In leaving the Divine unnamed and unclaimed, Valluvar did more than avoid controversy. He handed us a mirror polished with humility and universality. Name and form of the God matters, he seems to say, but the virtues we see in the Divine—and seek in ourselves, matter even more.","Thirukkural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.

KOCHI: The quaint town of Aluva in Ernakulam, Kerala, holds a special place in the heart of newly elected Pope Leo XIV . Nearly 20 years after his visit to the state, Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost - elected Pope on Thursday - fondly recalled waking up to the view of Periyar river from the Augustinian house in Mariyapuram, Aluva, during a conversation with Fr Wilson Injarapu, regional vicar of the Augustinian Order in India in Feb this year.Prevost visited Kerala twice, in 2004 and 2006, while serving as prior general of Order of St Augustine (OSA). Wilson was a student when he met Prevost. ""After meeting him in Kochi in 2006, nearly two decades passed before I saw him again in Feb. Yet he clearly remembered his visit and asked me about our community in Kerala. On both occasions he stayed at the house in Aluva for nearly a week,"" he said.For Prevost, Kerala is synonymous with greenery and natural beauty, Wilson said. ""He told us he remembered enjoying the greenery and river view as soon as he woke up,"" he said, adding that Prevost led a simple life and relished the local cuisine with his fellow brothers at the house.During his first visit in 2004, Prevost attended an ordination ceremony at St Francis Xavier Church in Kaloor and visited two religious houses in Aluva and Edakochi. In 2006, he made a brief visit to Shenbagam School in Pollachi and an Augustinian community in Thalapuzha, Wayanad.The priest recalled experiencing Prevost's humility during their Feb meeting in Rome. ""Though he was a cardinal, he stayed with me at the Augustinian house there. We prayed together, dined together and celebrated Mass. He served me lunch and even took away my plate to be washed,"" he said.Meanwhile, a group of six Augustinian priests are overjoyed at the papal election as Prevost, then their prior general, had attended their ordination in Kochi on April 22, 2004. Fr John Bosco Kuttuthara said he could not contain his excitement and a photograph of Prevost blessing him during the ceremony was now among his most cherished possessions.","Cardinal robert francis prevost fondly recalled waking up to the view of periyar river from the augustinian house in mariyapuram, aluva.
