Ajmer Dargah's 'no liability' notice draws flak from Muslim groups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ajmer-dargahs-no-liability-notice-draws-flak-from-muslim-groups/articleshow/122870453.cms,"Ajmer dargah

AJMER: A public notice issued by the nazim (chief executive officer) of Ajmer Dargah disowning responsibility for accidents caused by dilapidated structures within the shrine complex, has triggered widespread anger among Muslim organisations and the community's religious heads.The notice, dated July 21, was pasted inside Dargah premises, warning devotees to avoid old or structurally weak buildings that may collapse during heavy rains. It stated, ""In case of any accident or untoward incident, the individual will be solely responsible. The nazim office will not accept any legal liability.""The language and tone of the notice have been condemned by organisations from Delhi to Hyderabad, including the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind, All India Muslim Council and the Muslim Progressive Front (Rajasthan). Several groups have demanded an immediate withdrawal of the notice and called on the ministry of minority affairs to launch an inquiry into the matter.TOI texted and called Nazim Bilal Khan for a statement, but received no response. The Ajmer Dargah Committee functions under the ministry of minority affairs and the episode has renewed calls for greater accountability, transparency and professional oversight in the management of India's major religious heritage sites.Sohail Khandwani, managing trustee of Haji Ali and Mahim Dargah in Mumbai, who is currently overseeing renovation work at Haji Ali, expressed dismay: ""I came across the letter. I was shocked to learn that the nazim hasn't even identified which buildings are structurally unsafe, nor have any warning signs been placed. Simply issuing a letter will spark fear among devotees.""The Dargah receives 20,000 devotees on normal days, which jumps up to a lakh on Thursdays and Fridays.Syed Nadeem Hasan Nizami, chief in-charge of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah in Delhi, called the notice a ""hallmark of shamelessness and administrative negligence."" He said, ""Asking devotees to survey the complex, identify weak structures and then decide whether to proceed with ziyarat (visit the shrine) is absurd. What exactly is the Dargah nazim's role then? He should resign. I appeal to PM Narendra Modi to appoint qualified professionals with experience in management, auditing and public safety. ""The notice follows incidents of roof collapse and water seepage in at least three mosques within the Dargah complex in the past week.","Public notice issued by the nazim of ajmer dargah disowning responsibility for accidents caused by dilapidated structures.

11/7: HC cites psy theories to doubt 2 cabbies' statements,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/11/7-hc-cites-psy-theories-to-doubt-2-cabbies-statements/articleshow/122870356.cms,"July 11, 2007 bombings in Mumbai local trains

MUMBAI: Bombay HC in its verdict in the 11/7 train blasts case has referred to psychological and neurological studies for doubting the statements of taxi drivers who ferried those carrying explosives to Churchgate railway station and the witnesses who identified the planters on trains.The HC has cited the decay theory and cue-dependent theory that support the idea that memory fades over time, but can be re-triggered or recalled under certain conditions. Decay theory suggests memory fades simply with time. However, cue-dependent theory says the memory isn't gone. it is just inaccessible until the right trigger or cue occurs.The HC noted that the two taxi drivers did not approach police for 116 days following the blasts, believing they lacked significant information. During investigation, police located them after a 15-day search to identify the taxi drivers who had transported the accused to Churchgate station. The HC order said there were no station diary entries to corroborate this.In its order, the court noted that studies indicate face recognition is managed by a specific part of the brain that processes and stores facial features as complex visual patterns. Regular meetings increase the likelihood of recognition, whereas a single brief encounter may not create a strong memory unless it holds emotional or contextual significance.Distinctive features such as hairstyle, facial structure or voice aid recognition, whereas generic or familiar-looking faces are harder to recall accurately over time.""In case of such inordinate delay, an exception to the rule of a possibility that the witness may forget the features of the accused is that, the witness had ample opportunity of seeing the accused at the time of commission of offence,"" the HC said. The HC went on to explain how there is only a brief interaction between the passenger and driver where the driver is asked if the vehicle is occupied and the fare is paid as per the metre at the end of the journey.The trial court had deemed the cab drivers' testimonies as ""cogent and convincing evidence"" and described that as ""straightforward"" and ""not artificial"" while convicting the accused. But the HC, examining it with the help of the two theories, said ""observations of the trial court are perverse and contrary to well-settled principles of law.""The HC further stated it is common knowledge for taxi passengers in Mumbai to state their destination without elaborate instructions or negotiations. Typically, a passenger boards the taxi and then communicates the desired destination, to which the driver responds with a simple gesture or verbal confirmation. The court emphasised that, under normal circumstances, taxi drivers have limited interaction with passengers and insufficient opportunity to observe and memorise their faces for extended periods unless there is a specific reason.The high court took the same view while considering statements of witnesses who identified the planters in court after four years.""We, therefore, again examined the evidence of the witnesses to find out whether there was any special reason for these witnesses to recollect the faces of the accused after such a long period and for that we tried to find out whether these witnesses had sufficient opportunity or interact or observe or to see the accused to enable them to recollect their faces after such a long period,"" the HC said.",Bombay hc in its verdict in the 11/7 train blasts case refers to psychological and neurological studies.

All four are alleged to have been involved in propagating the ideology of AQIS, a banned terrorist outfit, and promoting content aimed at radicalization and recruitment, officials said.ATS DIG Sunil Joshi said the operation was launched after Deputy SP Harsh Upadhyay received a tip-off on June 10 about five Instagram accounts promoting al-Qaida ideologies. “The accounts were sharing content on a religious basis, against democracy and India,” he was quoted by ANI as saying.A technical team was formed to monitor the activity and trace the handlers. “All four were found to be involved. They were kept under surveillance and their physical movements were also found to be suspicious,” he added.Fardeen Shaikh was found in possession of a sword and literature related to al-Qaida. “We also recovered documents on ‘Operation Sindoor’ from him. The content was anti-Indian government, pro-Pakistani, and inciting in nature,” Joshi said. The group allegedly formed multiple Instagram groups where they circulated jihadi content and pushed for the implementation of Sharia law instead of democracy in India.Mohd Faiq, officials said, was in contact with several Pakistani Instagram accounts which supplied him with jihadi material. “They were disseminating a lot of content across India. We recovered and analyzed large amounts of data from their phones,” Joshi said.The FIR has been registered under Sections 13, 18, 38, and 39 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and Sections 113, 152, 196, and 68 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Fardeen and Saifullah were produced before a court on Wednesday and sent to 14-day remand. The other two accused, Mohd Faiq and Zeeshan Ali, will be produced in court on Thursday.Meanwhile, Saifullah’s brother, Ameen, expressed disbelief at the arrest. “I don’t know what he did or didn’t do on his phone.

We will see what the people want and what everyone’s opinion is,” Yadav told IANS when asked if a poll boycott was on the table.The remark came on a day of high drama in the Bihar assembly, where proceedings were adjourned within 30 minutes of the House convening due to heated exchanges over the SIR issue. Speaker Nand Kishor Yadav expressed displeasure at both ruling and opposition members, citing use of unparliamentary language and disorderly conduct.Tejashwi, who wore a black T-shirt as a mark of protest, was allowed to speak on the SIR issue. “We are not opposed to the special intensive revision per se, but how the Election Commission has been carrying out the exercise is objectionable,” he said. “Why so late, when elections are just around the corner? They could have conducted it a few months earlier.”Questioning the EC’s demand for documentation from voters, Yadav said, “Only two-three per cent of voters may have the documents that the EC is asking for. What is this fear of fake voters? Does the EC mean to say fake voters made Narendra Modi the PM and Nitish Kumar the CM?”He also raised concerns about 4.5 crore migrant voters in Bihar, questioning what would happen to them if they are not found at their registered addresses.“The EC has threatened to strike off their names,” he said.Chief minister Nitish Kumar intervened during the speech, telling Yadav, “You are a child. You know nothing of matters like these. Only three days are left of this last session. Let it conduct legislative business. Whatever rubbish you want to speak, you may do it during elections.”The CM also took a dig at the RJD’s record in power, saying, “When his parents were chief ministers, they did nothing for women, Muslims, or any other section. The only woman who got something was his mother.”The verbal clash led to chaos in the House. Cabinet colleagues tried to calm Kumar, while RJD MLA Bhai Virendra used unparliamentary language, prompting the Speaker to demand an apology. Deputy CM Vijay Sinha’s loud protests drew a sharp rebuke from the Speaker, who adjourned the House till lunch.Later, Tejashwi held a press conference, alleging that the ruling party was avoiding a meaningful discussion. “Fifty-five lakh people have been declared as not present at their registered addresses. What is going to be their fate?” he asked.“The Deputy CM may have been irked that I exposed the lie about Bangladeshis being on the voters’ list,” he added.When the Assembly resumed, opposition members entered the well, raised slogans and waved placards before staging a walkout.","Tejashwi yadav said the mahagathbandhan might consider boycotting the upcoming assembly elections.

Poll How do you feel about the current state of traffic management in Delhi during heavy rains? Much improved, it flows smoothly. Still chaotic, needs more work.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday hailed the Rekha Gupta-led Delhi government after ""traffic moved smoothly"" despite heavy rain at Minto Bridge which was first to flood every time.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared visuals of Minto Bridge, where vehicles were seen crossing without any hassle.""Despite heavy rain, traffic moved smoothly at Minto Bridge, once the first to flood with even a drizzle. That’s the change Delhi is witnessing under the BJP government in just a few months! From waterlogged roads to smooth flow, from chaos to order — a real transformation has begun,"" Malviya said in a social media post on X.""Delhi will now become the capital India truly deserves. Arvind Kejriwal had reduced it to a dustbin. BJP is cleaning up the mess and rebuilding the future.""The underpass, situated at the junction of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg and Connaught Place, is infamous for waterlogging every monsoon season. The issue gained national attention in 2020 when a 56-year-old man died after his mini-truck became submerged during a heavy downpour at the same location. In response, the government initiated new protocols to prevent similar incidents, but recurring waterlogging suggests these measures remain inadequate.Meanwhile, several low-lying areas in the capital reported knee-deep water following the downpour.Waterlogging and traffic disruptions affected several parts of Delhi, including South Delhi, South East Delhi, North Delhi, ITO, South Extension, NH-8, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, Nehru Place, East of Kailash, Colony Road, and several other areas.The Aam Aadmi Party accused the government of making false claims in the media about tackling the problem of waterlogging.""After the rain this morning, the road (NH-24) in the Western Vinod Nagar area is completely waterlogged. CM Rekha Gupta ji, where is your proper planning? You made grand claims in the media about tackling waterlogging, but today the whole of Delhi is submerged, and you're relaxing in your grand palace,"" AAP said in a social media post.""The public is now swimming on the streets and inviting all BJP leaders to join them for a swim,"" it added.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Safdarjung — the primary weather station of the national capital — recorded 5.6 mm of rainfall between 5:30 am and 8:30 am, while other stations reported higher amounts: Pragati Maidan recorded 16.6 mm, Pusa 10 mm, Janakpuri 9.5 mm, and Najafgarh 2 mm.Authorities have advised residents to stay indoors, avoid travel, follow traffic updates, stay away from electric poles and wires, and avoid sheltering under trees.The IMD has warned of continued rainfall over the coming days. The forecast predicts generally cloudy skies with very light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning, for the next seven days.Authorities have urged residents to avoid unnecessary travel and stay updated through official weather and traffic advisories.The minimum temperature was recorded at 25.6 degrees Celsius, 1.7 degrees below normal, while the maximum temperature is expected to settle around 33 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.","Bjp it cell head amit malviya shared visuals of minto bridge, where vehicles were seen crossing without any hassle.

As a result, police booked the accused under Section 151 of the CrPC (for breach of peace) and issued a challan.The clip has triggered an outpouring of support online, with users hailing the girl as brave and calling her actions a powerful example of standing up to harassment. Many demanded stronger deterrents for eve-teasing and praised her for refusing to suffer in silence.","A schoolgirl from uttar pradesh's unnao confronted and thrashed a man for allegedly harassing her repeatedly.

Govt begins search for Dhankhar's retirement home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-begins-search-for-dhankhars-retirement-home/articleshow/122870112.cms,"Jagdeep Dhankhar

NEW DELHI: With the govt accepting the resignation of Jagdeep Dhankhar and EC set to start the process of electing a new VP, the housing and urban affairs ministry has a task in hand - getting a retirement home for Dhankhar in Lutyens' Delhi. As per rule, the occupant of a designated govt accommodation gets 30 days to vacate it, officials said.A former VP is entitled for a Type-VIII bungalow - the highest category - and usually such an accommodation is provided in the Lutyens' bungalow zone. TOI has learnt that a bungalow in this category is available on K Kamraj Marg. Two former VPs - Hamid Ansari and M Venkaiah Naidu - have been allotted bungalows in the national capital.News agency PTI on Wednesday said Dhankhar's family has begun packing their belongings and plans to soon move out of the Vice President's Enclave.Earlier there were claims on social media that the VP's official residence had been sealed and Dhankhar had been asked to vacate the residence immediately, which the Press Information Bureau's Fact Check said was ""fake"".Officials said the govt would follow the norm of giving 30 days time for vacating official accommodation, and similarly, there will be termination of personal staff who are co-terminus with the ex-VP.Dhankhar had moved into the newly constructed VP Enclave on Church Road near North Block in April last year. Sources said Dhankhar got several modifications done to the complex, including building a swimming pool, and on several occasions he had complained of ""poor"" workmanship.","The housing and urban affairs ministry has a task in hand - getting a retirement home for jagdeep dhankhar in lutyens' delhi.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday directly asked BJP and the Modi govt to hold a farewell for Jagdeep Dhankhar, in a move that appeared to be the opposition party's bid to embarrass the governing camp which has given a curt parting to the VP after a sudden breakup in relationship.In a closed-door meeting of the business advisory committee of RS, senior Congress neta Jairam Ramesh conveyed to BJP stalwarts, which included key ministers and leader of the House J P Nadda, that Dhankhar should be given a send-off befitting of the high constitutional position he occupied. The context of his demand was the scheduled farewell on Thursday for RS MPs whose term is ending soon.Ramesh told TOI, ""There is going to be a farewell to the retiring members tomorrow in RS. So, I suggested why not have a farewell for the retired chairman also."" According to him, BJP netas kept mum.The appeal for farewell appeared more of a taunt as BJP and Dhankhar have had a bitter falling out amid indications that the VP resigned after earning the displeasure of the Modi govt for seeking to supersede the removal notice that the govt sponsored in Lok Sabha against Justice Yashwant Varma by entertaining a parallel one by the opposition in RS.His suggestion to suddenly move on the removal notice pending against Justice Shekhar Yadav of Allahabad HC for ""hate speech"" also did not go down well with the BJP brass. Post-resignation, there has been no praise or polite words that are customary for the high officials who leave their positions.Ramesh said, ""A farewell is the minimum courtesy we owe to the chairman who was also the Vice President of India. It is especially so for the govt which appointed him.""Meanwhile, CPM MP John Brittas demanded that the govt clarify the circumstances surrounding Dhankhar's resignation to ""protect the dignity of the second-highest constitutional office and address growing speculation"".
