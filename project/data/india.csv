Bihar polls: Prashant Kishor to make electoral debut; claims this will be Nitish Kumar's last election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-prashant-kishor-to-make-electoral-debut-claims-this-will-be-nitish-kumars-last-election/articleshow/124351415.cms,"Prashant Kishor (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for assembly elections across 243 seats, political strategist-turned-leader Prashant Kishor has confirmed that he will contest the polls, with his political startup Jan Suraaj set to unveil its list of candidates on October 9 -- a list he says will be “full of surprises.”The announcement followed Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar’s declaration of the Bihar election schedule, which will be conducted in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results to be announced on November 14. Bihar, with 243 constituencies, has the fourth-largest assembly in India.Speaking to reporters, Kishor said, ""The party will declare its list of candidates for the coming assembly polls on October 9 and it will be full of surprises. My name will also be there in the list.""The former poll strategist declined to reveal the constituency he will contest from, saying, ""You will come to know on October 9.""When asked about Jan Suraaj’s prospects, Kishor asserted that his party would attract a significant voter base that does not align with either of the major alliances. ""In the last polls, the two alliances bagged votes of 72 per cent of voters only. I must clarify that we will get votes of the remaining 28 per cent of the voters.Besides, people say that Jan Suraaj Party will get 10 per cent votes each of both alliances. That means we are expected to get 48 per cent votes of the total electorate in the coming polls,"" he said.He added that many believe Jan Suraaj will cut into the vote shares of both the NDA and the INDIA bloc.Kishor also took aim at Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, saying, ""I am saying it with full confidence that this will be the last election of Nitish Kumar. He will not celebrate the next 'Makar Sankranti' (in January 2026) at 1 Anne Marg, the official residence of the Bihar chief minister in the state capital.""He said this election would mark ""a new chapter"" in Bihar politics as people vote for ""the bright future of their children, against migration and unemployment.""The upcoming contest is set to be triangular -- the NDA alliance of BJP, JD(U), Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustan Awami Morcha, and Rashtriya Lok Shakti Party facing off against the INDIA bloc of RJD, Congress, CPI(ML), CPI, CPM, and Vikasheel Insaan Party, with Jan Suraaj emerging as a new challenger expected to disrupt traditional vote banks.","Prashant kishor's political startup jan suraaj set to unveil its list of candidates on october 9.

BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah ’s remarks that social reformer Basavanna conceived Lingayat as a separate religion have reignited an old controversy within Congress and triggered a war of words between ministers MB Patil and Eshwar Khandre, both Lingayats.Siddaramaiah had in 2017 sought a separate religion status for Lingayats, a move Congress later apologised for after losing the 2018 state polls.A day after the CM’s latest remarks, industries minister Patil said, “We are all Indians geographically and Hindus by faith, but like Jains or Sikhs, Lingayats are outside Hinduism’s caste system.” He added that the All India Veerashaiva-Lingayat Mahasabha was united on this.Countering him, minister Khandre said, “No force can divide Veerashaiva and Lingayat communities — both are one.” He said their distinct customs deserved recognition and urged for a separate column in the caste survey.

Bihar polls will test opposition's resilience at national level,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-will-test-oppositions-resilience-at-national-level/articleshow/124350567.cms,"Bihar polls will test opposition's resilience at national level

NEW DELHI: The battle royal of 2024 put the opposition back in the opposition benches. But only just, with the unmistakable message from the power play being that after a decade of reeling from Modi-led BJP 's cycle of victories, the anti-BJP bloc was robustly ascendant.Over a year-and-a-half later, the scenario for INDIA bloc has shifted firmly back to the gloomy days of pre-2024, with BJP having stolen convincing victories from expected defeats in Haryana and Maharashtra, making its equally embarrassing losses in Jharkhand and J&K a sideshow. This post-2024 context makes the coming battle for Bihar more consequential nationally, far outweighing the otherwise equally crucial local questions like if RJD can return to office after a hiatus of two decades, and if it can stop BJP from emerging from the shadow of allies to become the single-largest player in state for the first time in its history.By general reckoning, Bihar will be watched for whether opposition still has the resilience that put it within striking distance of winning in national contest last year, despite adverse circumstances skewing the playing field in favour of the incumbent.It is, by universal acceptance, an uphill task for INDIA bloc. The BJP-JDU combine is looking to use incumbency to its advantage, like by announcing massive doles for women voters in the run-up to the polls, backed by the face of Modi, with CM and JDU chief Nitish Kumar as the solid ally. The equation brings with it caste engineering that has helped the governing combine to tide over challenging circumstances, like in the narrow win in 2020 in the shadow of Covid pandemic.INDIA bloc believes it has done the basics right, like getting the allies together and running an early statewide campaign of cohesion through 'Vote Adhikar Yatra' headlined by Rahul Gandhi, with Tejashwi Yadav and others in tow. The outrage over voters' list revision turned out well for the alliance as SC stamped on its demand for enlarging the basket of documents for voter registration. If a chord was to be struck through the efforts, it happened.But taking on BJP-JDU is a challenge. The caste net of the two allies, from upper castes to weaker backward classes, is a solid foundation, and much would depend on how far the rainbow alliance of Congress-RJD-CPI (ML)-VIP has succeeded in socially denting the rival camp in past couple of years since they came together with a purpose.If RJD managed to run the rivals ragged five years ago, it was helped by the unrest caused by grievances over Covid relief and Chirag Paswan's contesting solo, with LJP's gun trained on CM Nitish. This time, Paswan is an ally of BJP-JDU, which is a huge plus for the governing combine.Sources said positives for opposition are Nitish's Muslim voters are angry over waqf law & BJP's unmitigated 'communal' rhetoric. Also, there is hope that most backwards are not sure of his primacy in the alliance, with doubts about his becoming the CM, which could persuade them to go for opposition - a possible reason Tejashwi has been talking about Nitish's 'erratic behaviour', claiming he is in ""achet awastha"" (an unconscious state). The other hope is that pollster-turned-politician and Jan Suraaj Party chief Prashant Kishor would dent the BJP-JDU support base and help opposition.","Bihar polls will test opposition's resilience at national level.

JAIPUR: The acrid smell of burnt chemicals and equipment hung heavy in the air at Jaipur’s SMS Hospital on Monday, as family members of those who died in the tragedy lingered outside the mortuary to collect the remains of their loved ones.Fighting back tears, traumatised witnesses and relatives described the horrific scenes of chaos and recounted how helpless they had felt as the fire ravaged through the ICU, scalding their lives too.Bharatpur-based Sheru, whose desperate attempt to save his mother, Rukmani Kaur (45), failed, said: “Around 11.20 pm, I noticed smoke billowing out of the ceiling and informed a nurse. She, however, dismissed my fear, saying a machine had probably overheated.”“In 20 minutes, thick smoke filled the area, leaving me blinded and unable to reach my mother’s bed. The doctors had said my mother was recovering quickly and could be discharged within a couple of days. Now that she is dead, whom should I hold responsible?” asked Sheru.Vikram Gurjar lost his brother, Pintu Gurjar (35), to the blaze. “We were waiting to take him home after doctors said he would be released in a day or two.Now we’re taking his body back,” he said.Narendra Kumar, whose mother Khushma (45) died in the fire, expressed anger and frustration at the lack of a proper emergency response. “My father called me at 11.45 pm to inform me about the fire. When I reached the ICU, the situation was chaotic. People were piling out of the trauma centre, with some of them pushing ICU beds with patients still hooked to IV drips and monitors. We couldn’t rescue my mother due to the intensity of the blaze,” he said.Om Prakash, whose son was hospitalised with a head injury, recalled seeing staff pushing and shoving patients out onto the road in complete panic. “This was not just negligence but a systemic failure”, he said.

EC on opposition attacks: ‘We don’t react to political rhetoric’

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Monday announced two-phase assembly polls in Bihar on Nov 6 and 11, setting the stage for what is likely to be largely a straight contest between traditional foes - the Nitish Kumar-led BJP-JD(U) governing coalition and the Tejashwi Yadav-led 'Mahagathbandhan' of RJD Congress and CPI(ML).Counting for all 243 seats will be held on November 14.The feisty Prashant Kishor-promoted Jan Suraaj threatens to disrupt the bipolar matchup, to be held after a contentious special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls conducted amid allegations of ""vote theft"", just as estranged NDA ally Chirag Paswan and his Lok Janshakti Party did five years ago.Elections in Bihar have traditionally been influenced by caste and this one, the first to be held after the caste survey, does not promise to be an exception. But like the previous ones, it will not be determined by that one factor alone. Tejashwi Yadav and his allies, Congress and CPI (ML), have targeted NDA for its two-decade-long incumbency, focusing on lack of jobs, resultant migration and other kitchen table issues.NDA, in turn, has stayed focused on lawlessness and anarchy that defined RJD’s reign under Lalu-Rabri, while also highlighting improved infrastructure, law and order and restoration of governance.Bihar polls, since the turn of the century, have also been a contest between RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar . Lalu, beset with serious medical complications, has since passed on the baton to Tejashwi, his younger son, and has anointed him successor.But this has not dulled intensity of the fight between the duo. They buried the hatchet twice, only to resume the fight. Tejashwi has turned out to be a worthy legatee and has inherited his father’s following among the formidable ‘M-Y’ bloc.Nitish, though hobbled by health issues, has also retained goodwill among the constituency that he forged among non-Yadav OBCs and extremely backward castes.After SIR, which saw deletion of nearly 68.7 lakh voters and addition of around 21.5 lakh, including 14 lakh first-timers aged 18-19 years, Bihar electorate stands at 7.4 crore, of which 3.9 crore are male and 3.5 crore female. The announcement of Bihar polls came a day before Supreme Court conducts its final hearing on the slew of petitions challenging the SIR exercise.When asked to comment on opposition’s recurrent questions on credibility of the commission, CEC Gyanesh Kumar, at a press conference on Monday to announce the poll dates, said EC “does not react to political rhetoric”.“Bihar has shown the way to rest of the country... the state’s 243 electoral registration officers, over 90,000 booth level officers and 1.6 booth level agents worked together to purify the state’s electoral rolls,” said the CEC, while confirming that the SIR exercise will now be replicated on a pan-India scale.While 121 assembly constituencies in Bihar, covering entire western and central Bihar, will vote in the first phase on November 6, the remaining 122 ACs, spread across Seemanchal and north and south Bihar, will witness polling in the second and final phase on November 11. This is the shortest poll Bihar will be seeing in several decades, an outcome linked by the CEC to voter awareness, improved law and order situation, availability of central armed police forces and increase in polling personnel capacity.","Bihar assembly elections: bjp, tejashwi eye spring in autumn of the patriarchs.

Poll Do you think the safety measures on flights are adequate? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet, to Birmingham on Saturday. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for checks. The RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.While the Boeing 787 was released for service by Sunday evening (India time), the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) says “requires detailed investigation” which has been assigned to a senior air safety official. At the time of filing this story, AI was evaluating whether to operate the about 12-year-old VT-ANO back to India as a scheduled or a ferry (without passengers) flight.RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Hence its deployment created a flutter on Saturday when the deployment happened on yet another AI B787-8 Dreamliner.In a statement, AI said: “The operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of the aircraft during its final approach.All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing at Birmingham. The aircraft has been grounded for further checks and consequently, AI114 from Birmingham to Delhi has been cancelled and alternative arrangements are being made to accommodate the guests. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority.”AI 117 had taken off from Amritsar at 12.52 pm on Oct 4. “During landing at 400 feet, RAT unlock message came and RAT got deployed. Pilots did not report any related abnormality. The aircraft landed safely (at Birmingham 7.07 pm, all local timings),” said a senior official, adding, “Boeing has issued a ‘fleet team digest’ containing brief of previous such cases.”According to aviation website Skybrary: “RAT is a small turbine that is installed in an aircraft and used as an alternate or emergency hydraulic or electrical power source. (It) generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump.”“In general, modern aircraft only utilise RAT in emergency: either in the event of loss of hydraulic systems or following the loss of primary electrical generation. In these cases the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. Some RATs produce only hydraulic power which in turn is used to power an electrical generator,” Skybrary adds.","The ram air turbine (rat) of an air india dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

NEW DELHI: In the high-stakes showdown for Bihar assembly polls, NDA, helmed by BJP and CM Nitish Kumar's JDU , is expecting a resounding endorsement of its ""double engine"" governance, claiming to have lifted the state from 'Jungle Raj' quagmire to the cusp of 'Viksit Bihar'.Home minister Amit Shah said on Monday that NDA government has pulled Bihar out of 'Jungle Raj' and given it a new direction of development and good governance, and expressed confidence that the state's people will once again choose politics of development in the coming polls.BJP president JP Nadda and JDU executive president Sanjay Jha sounded equally confident as they asserted that the polls are for continuing the state's development, ridding it of infiltrators, and stopping return of 'misgovernance'.Matrize opinion poll has projected a landslide victory for NDA with the alliance's vote share expected at 49%, translating into 150-160 seats in the 243-member assembly. 'Mahagathbandhan' (RJD-Congress-Left combine) is expected to garner 36%, accounting for 70-85 seats, it said. The projections, though always taken with a pinch of salt, will further boost the mood in NDA camp.Governing coalition views the election calendar as a canvas to paint its narrative of progress with steady focus on welfarism, even as it braces for opposition INDIA bloc's ""caste-driven"" counteroffensive.PM Modi's popularity, coupled with announcements of social empowerment schemes & development projects, complements Nitish's 'Sushasan Babu' image. The 9-term CM is seen to have retained his grip over extremely backward classes (EBCs), bolstered by an attempted 27% EBC reservation hike and local body quotas for women.Central to NDA's strategy, however, is to capitalise on the image of Modi also as a move to combat possibility of fatigue among voters after two decades of Nitish's incumbency. Besides, Shah's tactical acumen is seen as a decisive factor as he has played a crucial role in consolidating the alliance & equation among partners with a reasonable seat-sharing formula, likely to be announced soon.Yet NDA's journey isn't without potholes. Internal performance audits have indicated anti-incumbency for several sitting MLAs, prompting ticket denials to inject fresh blood, resulting in rebellions. Nitish's health is another factor that ignites hope in opposition camp even as NDA parties have played it down.","Nda, helmed by bjp and cm nitish kumar's jdu, is expecting a resounding endorsement of its 'double engine' governance.

Not being allowed to meet Wangchuk, wife tells Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to Centre and Ladakh UT on a petition filed by Sonam Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali J Angmo, challenging his detention under the stringent National Security Act, but refused to pass interim order to the authorities to give her the grounds of arrest after it was alleged they had been “served on the detenue (Wangchuk)”.Posting hearing on October 14, SC asked why she too shouldn’t be given grounds of arrest.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria that he would examine the feasibility of providing grounds of detention to Sonam Wangchuk’s family.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Angmo, contended that she was not being allowed to meet him. SC asked her to approach the authority concerned and allowed her to move court if denied.

The bench remarked, “Grounds have to be supplied as per judgments of this court. Why withhold it from his wife?” Mehta said the law requires grounds of arrest to be served on the detenue, not the wife, but added, “We will examine it.No issues as such, but we don’t want them to create a new ground to challenge the detention order. ”The SG also claimed a hype was being created in the media, which Sibal strongly rebutted. The two got entangled in counter-allegations until the bench intervened, asking both not to make emotional arguments. In a lighter vein, Sibal said, “The SG kept provoking me and I fell into his trap.”Justice Aravind Kumar, smiling, remarked, “We do not know what is going on,” to which Sibal replied, “You should know what is going on.”Wangchuk was detained under NSA on September 26, days after protests demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for Ladakh left four dead.

'Judicial Activism Must Not Become' Chief Justice BR Gavai's Powerful Message Against Overreach

Poll Should the Supreme Court have intervened in the idol reconstruction plea? Yes, it's an important cultural issue. No, it's an archaeological matter.

NEW DELHI: An advocate attempted to hurl a shoe at Chief Justice of India (CJI) BR Gavai on Monday, allegedly in protest against his recent “go ask your deity” remark made while hearing a plea seeking reconstruction of a Lord Vishnu idol in Madhya Pradesh’s Khajuraho.An advocate, who was heard shouting slogans, was quickly escorted out of the courtroom by security personnel. The incident caused a brief interruption for a few minutes in proceedings before the session resumed, reported Live Law.According to lawyers present, the individual shouted, “” (“India will not tolerate disrespect towards Sanatan Dharma”) while being removed from the courtroom. Some witnesses claimed he tried to throw a shoe, while others said he appeared to be hurling a roll of paper. The man was reportedly dressed in a lawyer's robe.Reacting to the incident, CJI Gavai said: ""Don't get distracted by all this. We are not distracted. These things do not affect me.""Terming it a ""publicity interest litigation"", the Supreme Court last month dismissed a plea seeking directions to reconstruct and reinstall a seven-foot idol of Lord Vishnu at the Javari Temple, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Khajuraho temple complex in MP.A bench headed by Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran refused to entertain the plea filed by one Rakesh Dalal, who sought the replacement and consecration of the damaged idol at the Javari Temple in Chhatarpur district.""This is purely publicity interest litigation... Go and ask the deity himself to do something. If you are saying you are a strong devotee of Lord Vishnu, then you pray and do some meditation,"" the CJI said.The petitioner's counsel said the idol's head was dilapidated & urged SC to intervene to allow its reconstruction.SC said the issue squarely fell under Archaeological Survey of India's jurisdiction . ""It's an archaeological find, whether ASI would permit such a thing to be done or not... there are various issues,"" CJI said.The CJI added, ""In the meantime, if you are not averse to Shaivism, you can go and worship there... there is a very big linga of Shiva, one of the biggest in Khajuraho.""",An advocate attempted to hurl a shoe at chief justice of india (cji) br gavai on monday.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain former Tamil Nadu minister V Senthil Balaji's plea seeking clarification that the apex court had not barred him from holding public office saying that the order was very clear and he can file application in case he wants to be minister again.Balaji, who became minister just two days after the apex court had granted him bail, had to resign after the court strongly objected to his conduct and had asked him to choose between freedom and post. Though the order did not mention that he was barred from holding public office, he chose to approach court to seek clarification. But the court said that the order was very clear and no clarification was needed.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Balalji, said the court cannot issue the mandate to bar a person from holding public office when he is not convicted and the apex court's April order against the former minister should not be understood to convey that he cannot hold public office.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, however, said that the very strong observation was passed by the court in its order for becoming minister two days after getting bail. ""You file application in case you want to be minister,"" the bench said.""There is nothing in order which requires clarification. The order is very clear,"" the bench said.The bench also suggested that the trial in cash-for-job 'scam' be tranferred from Tamil Nadu to Delhi and sought response from the state which strongly objected to the idea.
