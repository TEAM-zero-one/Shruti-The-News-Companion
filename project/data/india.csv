Karnataka govt favouring big fish with links to ministers: Contractors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-govt-favouring-big-fish-with-links-to-ministers-contractors/articleshow/120186509.cms,"BENGALURU/CHITRADURGA: Days after Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah's economic adviser, Basavaraj Rayareddi, caused a flutter by claiming the state was ""No 1 in corruption"" before retracting the statement, the Congress govt has faced further embarrassment.The Karnataka State Contractors' Association has now alleged growing interference by middlemen in govt departments, accusing the administration of favouring big influential contractors while sidelining small and medium ones.In a letter addressed to Siddaramaiah, his deputy DK Shivakumar, public works minister Satish Jarkiholi, and minor irrigation minister NS Boseraju, association president R Manjunath and general secretary GM Ravindra have demanded an official meeting to discuss the crisis. ""In the last 3-4 months, middlemen are spoiling the system,"" the association said in its representation to the CM.Manjunath told TOI pending dues to contractors have crossed Rs 32,000 crore. ""Govt should maintain the seniority list to clear pending bills. However, there are middlemen - described as 'invisible hands' - in each dept, and they help some influential contractors, doing injustice to the small and medium-level contractors.""The association alleged that while departments like PWD, four irrigation corporations, and minor irrigation continue to withhold payments ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, special letters of credit (LoCs) are being selectively used to benefit contractors with political backing. These LOCs, intended for emergencies such as health issues or family events, are reportedly being misused.Contractors working with BBMP in Bengaluru have also alleged that bribe-demanding middlemen influence bill clearances in the city, favouring those with deeper pockets.At a press conference in Chitradurga, Manjunath claimed interference by ministers' relatives and aides in department functioning. ""While relatives of ministers have gained undue influence across departments, ministerial interference has increased in recent months. The ministers establish proper payment schedules, but intermediaries alter these arrangements to facilitate selective disbursement.""Despite raising these issues in a meeting with DK Shivakumar on Dec 3, Manjunath said their concerns remain unresolved. ""Substantial amounts of Rs 100-150 crore are being allocated to influential parties, while smaller contractors face neglect,"" he said, adding, ""The water resources department suspended payments while, in minor irrigation, minister Boseraj's son's involvement raised concerns regarding grants and payments.""","The karnataka state contractors' association has now alleged growing interference by middlemen in govt departments.

It also criticised Congress for ""not doing anything"" to punish those involved in the terror attack, which killed 166 people.""During Congress's time, terrorists had attacked the very hotel we are standing in. People died here. However, Congress didn't do anything to punish those involved. The one who was caught, Kasab, was served biryani.

""India will neither forgive nor forget the terrorists,"" he added.Poonawala said senior Congress functionaries even tried to create a ""fake narrative"", alleging that the attacks, including the one in Mumbai, were conspiracies by RSS and Hindus.BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said the first resolve of the Modi govt was zero tolerance against crime.Surender Singh, former National Security Guard commando who was part of the operation during the 2008 attack, said Rana's hanging would be a ""tight slap"" to Pakistan and terrorism.

Mumbai market tries to erase memory of Headley office 26/11 plotter helped build,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-market-tries-to-erase-memory-of-headley-office-26/11-plotter-helped-build/articleshow/120185638.cms,"MUMBAI: The Immigration Law Centre 's former location at Tardeo's AC Market has become virtually untraceable amidst the building's numerous commercial establishments. The history of this office, which was used as a cover by David Headley with the help of Tahawwur Rana in plotting one of India's most devastating terror attacks, remains a sensitive topic with occupants of various premises in the market.From this office space, the Law Centre, established through Rana's financial support and Headley's planning, operated under the guise of helping workers obtain visas for North American countries. The premises were strategically chosen to facilitate Headley's surveillance activities across Mumbai and other Indian cities.Rana, who operated an immigration services office in Chicago, US, as a cover for terrorist activities, established a Mumbai branch here at the suggestion of his childhood friend Headley two years before the 26/11 attacks , following directives from their Pakistani handlers.According to Headley's court testimony, Rana provided financial backing for the office. Headley had hired a local woman to manage the office, who testified before the court later about Rana's visit to the office with a woman before the terror attacks.While the immigration office was opened ostensibly to help skilled and unskilled workers get visas for the US and Canada, Headley used it as a cover to visit India, meet his contact and do recce of the possible targets.Currently, the AC Market houses various commercial establishments, including advocates' chambers and those of immigration consultants. The building's narrow corridors lead to compact office spaces, with some units having just enough space for basic furniture.The office's operations began on Nov 1, 2006, following a formal agreement with the landlord by Headley. Financial transactions between Rana and Headley were conducted through IndusInd Bank's Nariman Point branch, with multiple transfers used for setting up the office and for the recce of possible terror targets.Present-day occupants of the AC Market offices, including new staff members and the society manager, maintain minimal knowledge about the tainted office's controversial past. Renovation of nearby office spaces and a regular turnover of tenants have contributed to the gradual erasure of this contentious past from local memory.Prior to the 26/11 attacks, Rana and his wife undertook extensive travels across India, visiting multiple cities including Delhi, Agra, Kochi, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Headley's last documented interaction at the premises was on July 16, 2008, when he secured an extension for the office licence.","The immigration law centre's former location at tardeo's ac market has become virtually untraceable.

However, a brief but intense spell of rain accompanied by strong winds in the evening offered much-needed respite.The winds, gusting up to 50 kmph in parts of the city, brought the mercury down by a significant 6-10 degrees across most areas, said India Meteorological Department (IMD). The Met department predicted very light rain or drizzle on Friday and Saturday, with heatwave conditions unlikely till April 16.Parts of Delhi reeled under heatwave conditions for the fourth consecutive day. The maximum temperature at Safdarjung, the city's base station, reached 39.6 degrees Celsius on Thursday, five degrees above normal, down from Wednesday's 40.5 degrees Celsius. While Safdarjung didn't register heatwave conditions, Ayanagar (40.2 degrees Celsius) and Ridge (40.9 degrees Celsius) were under the grip of a heatwave.

However, Mayur Vihar experienced a decline from 37 degrees Celsius to 27 degrees Celsius during the same period due to more activity over eastern Delhi, said Mishra.According to IMD, base station Safdarjung did not record any rain between 5.30pm and 8.30pm while Mayur Vihar logged 5mm rainfall during the same period.

(PTI)

Poll How do you feel about Rekha Gupta's admission of past errors? I think it's too late I appreciate her honesty

‘I’m not the same person I was years ago’

Posters off, apologies on

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta has broken her silence on the backlash over her use of the word “thulla” in the Assembly last month, saying it was never meant to insult police personnel. In an interview with PTI, the 50-year-old leader acknowledged the criticism, admitted past errors, and said she’s “not fool-proof” but willing to evolve.“I used the word ‘thulla’ while narrating a story. It was not my intention to harm police personnel or jawans,” she said. “I have immense respect for them. They work 24 hours a day, often without rest or food, always just a phone call away.”The term “thulla” is commonly used as street slang to refer to beat cops in a derogatory manner. Gupta’s remark, made during a March 28 Assembly session, sparked sharp reactions from the Aam Aadmi Party, which called it an insult to the force.But Gupta, who led the BJP to power in Delhi after 26 years, is not shying away from accountability. “Sometimes we commit mistakes without any intention. What’s important is to accept them and ensure they are not repeated,” she said. “I don’t mind accepting my mistakes.”Responding to questions about her earlier aggressive posts on social media targeting opposition leaders, Gupta chalked them up to immaturity. “When we’re younger, we lack command over our language… as we grow, we mature,” she said. “It happens in everyone’s life. I’m no exception.”She added, “I’m a person who convinces others or gets convinced by them. I don’t believe in one-sided thinking.”In a candid admission, Gupta acknowledged that her own supporters may have contributed to the defacement of Delhi’s public walls with political posters in the past—something she’s now campaigning against.“When I realised how ugly Delhi looks with posters and wall-writings, I started by apologising to the people,” she said. “I’ve now asked all our MLAs and workers to stop this practice. We must move toward a clean and beautiful Delhi.”Gupta said she doesn’t see herself as a one-woman force trying to change the capital. “The vision for Viksit Delhi, Swachh Delhi, Swasth Delhi—it’s not just my mission. Every citizen must be a part of it.”","Rekha gupta has broken her silence on the backlash over her use of the word ‘thulla’ in the assembly last month.

NEW Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday slammed the Centre regarding delays in establishing a cashless medical treatment scheme for motor accident victims.

They warned of potential contempt proceedings.The secretary was instructed to appear on April 28 for explanation.The court additionally instructed the transport department secretary to provide written directives to district magistrates regarding uploading hidden hit-and-run claims on the GIC portal.On January 8, the court had directed the Centre to create a scheme for cashless treatment during the 'golden hour' as per law.Referencing Section 162(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act , 1988, the government was ordered to implement the scheme by March 14.The Act defines golden hour under Section 2 (12-A) as the crucial one-hour period post-trauma when medical intervention is most effective.The court emphasised that financial and procedural delays often result in fatalities.It highlighted the Centre's statutory obligation under Section 162 to create a cashless treatment scheme, supporting Article 21's right to life guarantee.The law requires insurance companies to provide treatment for accident victims during the golden hour according to the MV Act scheme.Despite being effective from April 1, 2022, the scheme remained unimplemented, necessitating court intervention.The Centre proposed a draft limiting treatment cost to Rs 1.5 lakh for seven days, which the petitioner's counsel deemed inadequate.The GIC was assigned to manage hit-and-run compensation claims and develop a streamlined portal. This portal would facilitate document uploads, notify states of deficiencies, and reduce processing delays.

CJI Dipak Misra: Singapore Supreme Court Quashes 'Copy-Pasted' Arbitration Award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/singapore-sc-quashes-ex-cji-dipak-misras-copy-pasted-arbitration-award/articleshow/120141717.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major embarrassment, Singapore Supreme Court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) set up to manage dedicated freight corridors in India after finding that the tribunal headed by retired CJI Dipak Misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties but on different issues.Though the tribunal also comprised MP HC ex-Chief Justice K K Lahoti and ex-CJ of J&K HC Gita Mittal, a Singapore SC bench led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said since the other two were not part of the earlier awards, it couldn't be ascertained whether they were even aware of Misra's ""copy-paste"" job.The Singapore SC was firm that the copying compromised the integrity of the arbitration process and thus it did not adhere to the ""principles of natural justice"".The court said, ""The patently substantial material derived from parallel arbitrations were extraneous considerations that hadn't been raised to the parties' attention. The material formed such a pervasive part of the award that it simply could not be overlooked. It was plain that it was neither contemplated nor agreed to by the parties that the award could be prepared by such a process. We agree with the (Singapore HC) judge there had been a breach of the fair hearing rule.""By its award dated Nov 24, 2023, the Justice Misra-led tribunal had ruled in favour of the three firms which formed a consortium to bag the contract for Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in Aug 2015. A dispute arose because of the Indian govt's decision to raise labour wages, leading to the consortium demanding more money which was contested by the SPV, and the matter was referred to the Justice Misra-led arbitration tribunal.Upholding the Singapore HC's decision to set aside the award, Justices Menon and Steven Chong in a 40-page judgment analysed the award, found it plagued by copying and in breach of the principles of natural justice. The Justice Menon-led bench accepted the SPV's arguments and rejected those of the consortium.The SPV contended that Justice Misra, during the arbitration, had used extensive material derived from parallel arbitrations. ""It is also common ground that the award was not drafted afresh. Rather, the parallel awards were used as templates, with adjustments made to account for what were thought to be the specificities of the arbitration,"" the Singapore SC said.CJ Menon said the SPV had abandoned some of the submissions made in the parallel arbitrations and replaced these with new arguments unique to the arbitration at hand. ""These new arguments arose because of the slightly different factual matrix presented by the arbitration: for instance, the difference in the length of delay between the issuance of the notification and the consortium's claim allowed the SPV to make additional arguments on estoppel,"" he said.""Despite this, the parallel awards were used as templates in drafting the award to a very substantial degree. It is undisputed that at least 212 paragraphs from the parallel awards were retained in the 451-paragraph award. This has several implications,"" the Singapore SC said.""We also consider that the expectation of equality between the arbitrators was compromised. While, as we have noted, there is no evidence as to what transpired between the members of the tribunal, it is known that the two co-arbitrators in this case were not privy to the parallel arbitrations. They would thus have had no direct access to any material or knowledge derived from those proceedings, but which appeared to have significantly influenced the outcome of the present arbitration. The integrity of the arbitration was, therefore, further compromised as a result,"" it said.",Singapore supreme court has quashed an arbitral award against the special purpose vehicle ( spv) the tribunal headed by retired cji dipak misra had copied 212 of 451 paragraphs from two earlier awards involving the same parties.

"We've rights too, says ED; Be sensitive to others' rights: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/weve-rights-too-says-ed-be-sensitive-to-others-rights-sc/articleshow/120185038.cms,"NEW DELHI: Courts are deluged with writs seeking protection of rights. But the one which turned up before Supreme Court bench of Justices Abhay Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan a few days ago grabbed attention because it fell in the 'rarest of rare' category. It was filed by Enforcement Directorate which has been at the receiving end of rights-enforcement petitions.Though the anti-money laundering agency, through additional solicitor general S V Raju, withdrew the plea Tuesday, it will go down in court records for its extraordinariness. Appearing before the bench, Raju argued that ED also had rights. ""We expect you to be sensitive also to the rights of others,"" the bench reparteed on a lighter note.ED had filed the petition against alleged non-cooperation of Chhattisgarh police with its probe into the Rs 2,100 crore liquor 'scam' that unfolded under the then Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress govt in state. The plea was withdrawn, sources said, because Chhattisgarh police's approach changed after Congress's defeat in assembly polls. In fact, a subsequent affidavit filed by Chhattisgarh govt in Aug 2024, (after formation of a BJP govt in state), supported ED's allegation of nexus between Economic Offences Wing of Chhattisgarh police and one of the principal accused in the liquor 'scam', IAS officer Anil Tuteja .In its now-withdrawn petition, ED had cited ""evidence"" to claim that Chhattisgarh police had not just shared drafts of reports on the status of its investigation with Tuteja but had also agreed to carry out changes suggested by him. ED went on to say that Chhattisgarh police influenced a witness to retract his statement under PMLA. ""The purpose of sharing the draft (SIT report) was to seek approval from the accused persons before the same could be filed before (Chhattisgarh) HC,"" the fresh affidavit said.ED arrested Tuteja on April 21, 2024, after the agency claimed (in its remand note) that it had recovered digital evidence of the IAS officer allegedly receiving over Rs 14 crore from proceeds of crime. The agency subsequently seized Rs 16 crore of assets allegedly linked to Tuteja and his associates out of about Rs 200 crore of total attachments in the case. ED had submitted ""evidence"" of regular contact between Chhattisgarh police and Tuteja, including a WhatsApp chat purportedly between the IAS officer's son and and one of the members of the SIT, with the former sharing the advice of his father's counsel on how to draft the report on the status of investigation.In another purported exchange with Tuteja Jr, the then head of EOW and Anti-Corruption Bureau discussed ""efforts"" to influence witnesses to get them to depose in favour of the IAS officer.""The chats reveal role of successive chiefs of EOW/ACB in diluting the case against prime accused of predicate offence, Anil Tuteja and Alok Shukla,"" the affidavit said, adding ""the draft report of SIT was vetted by the prime accused, Anil Tuteja, with the help of his advocate Peeyush Bhatia"".The affidavit also mentioned role of advocate general under Congress govt.","Ed had filed the petition against alleged non-cooperation of chhattisgarh police with its probe into the rs 2,100 crore liquor'scam' that unfolded under the then bhupesh baghel-led congress govt in state.

"Tobacco use leading to heart ailments, causing sudden deaths, say doctors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tobacco-use-leading-to-heart-ailments-causing-sudden-deaths-say-doctors/articleshow/120182655.cms,"NEW DELHI: The death of a 28-year-old Air India Express pilot due to cardiac arrest, shortly after landing his flight in Delhi on Wednesday, and that of a 23-year-old woman while dancing at a wedding in Madhya Pradesh in Feb, has put the spotlight on rising incidents of sudden cardiac deaths among young people. Social media is flooded with videos of people collapsing and dying suddenly while dancing, singing or just taking a walk, either due to cardiac arrest or heart attack - the conditions becoming more common in the under-40 age group.Recently at AIIMS, Dr Ambuj Roy, a senior cardiologist at the hospital, treated a 26-year-old man after he suffered a massive heart attack. He was physically fit and there was no history of any chronic illness but doctors found that he was a heavy smoker. ""People associate tobacco-use, whether it is a smokeless product or smoking, with lung diseases and cancer. But if you look at the statistics, number of deaths caused by heart diseases, where tobacco use is a culprit, is almost equivalent to the number of deaths caused by the other two diseases,"" Dr Roy said.His colleague, Dr Nitesh Naik, called for increased awareness to reduce modifiable risk factors, which can lead to serious heart conditions, including heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest. These risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and obesity. ""It is equally important for people aged 40 and above to undergo periodic health check-ups to screen for underlying heart diseases. Timely detection and intervention can reduce the risk of serious complications,"" he said.In the pilot's case, it is not yet clear what triggered cardiac arrest or sudden loss of heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. But the incident has triggered concerns regarding long work hours and stress among pilots. Several mechanisms have been postulated for linking stress with cardiovascular diseases, say doctors. This includes behavioural factors such as smoking, excess alcohol intake, lack of exercise, poor adherence to medications and increased heart rate and raised blood pressure. These factors, doctors add, may either individually or in combination lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with a higher degree of stress.","Social media flooded with videos of people collapsing and dying suddenly.

The rules allow the Union govt to suspend funds to a state pending an investigation, but also state that Centre should ""institute appropriate remedial measures for its proper implementation within a reasonable period of time"", he added.The bench also directed the state to file an affidavit stating why unemployment allowance should not be given to people who have remained jobless for the last three years, as provided in MGNREGA.The high court gave three weeks to both the Centre and the state govt to file their affidavits, and posted the matter for hearing on May 15. The release of MGNREGS funds to Bengal have been withheld since March 9, 2022.Chief Justice Sivagnanam noted that the both stakeholders found ""misuse"" and ""defalcation"" of funds in four districts - Hooghly, East Burdwan, Malda and Darjeeling GTA area. The state said more than Rs 2.37 crore has already been recovered from the four districts (out of Rs 5.37 crore).Additional solicitor general Asoke Kumar Chakraborty submitted that central teams inspected MGNREGS accounts in 15 districts, but the Chief Justice said the documents available with the court mention only four districts. He directed the Centre to bring on record whether it had made similar recommendations for districts other than the four.The CJ also wanted to know what measures the central govt would take to implement the scheme prospectively, and why it should not be renewed in districts other than the four where there had been misuse of funds. The bench then directed the Centre to clarify how it proposed to use the Rs 2.37 crore already recovered and deposited in the state nodal account of MGNREGS.","The release of mgnregs funds to bengal have been withheld since march 9, 2022.
