In India, around 9,500 persons below 18 years died in road crashes in 2023.The Unicef report released at the 4th ministerial conference said that the African region reports around 46% of all child fatalities as pedestrian-related. By contrast, in the European region, 50% of road deaths in this age group occurs among vehicle occupants.""Powered two-wheelers are prominent in South Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific, while they are much less so on the African continent and the Caribbean,” it said.The report highlighted how children and adolescents are more vulnerable on roads in the LMICs as the rate of road traffic death among children and adolescents are up to three times higher in these countries than in high-income nations. “LMICs often lack adequate infrastructural and safety measures, such as road markings, raised intersections, sidewalks and traffic lights, as well as enforced road safety policies, that are needed to protect young road users,” the report said.The findings of the global status report gains importance considering that there are 3.3 billion children and adolescents aged below 19 years and 90% of them live in LMICs.Highlighting several policy gaps such as only 37.2% of countries testing all drivers involved in a fatal collision for alcohol and 33.7% have set age and height criteria for child motorcycle passengers, the report has recommended enacting and enforcing legislation requiring a maximum speed limit of 30 kmph on roads around schools and legislation to reduce maximum speeds on all urban roads to a safe level.",A little over 1.8 lakh children and adolescents below the age of 19 years lose their lives on the roads annually across the globe.

Poll How Can Water Contamination Risks Be Addressed at Major Events? Raise Public Awareness on Health Risks Improve Water Quality and Monitoring

What is faecal coliform?

'Increase in faecal concentration'

'High levels of faecal and total coliform at various locations'

'Quality of Ganga water not good for bathing'

'People back from Kumbh experiencing medical issues'

'

Respiratory tract infections

due to crowded settings'

NEW DELHI: Water quality at several locations in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj during the ongoing Maha Kumbh did not meet primary bathing standards due to high faecal coliform levels, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) informed the National Green Tribunal on Monday.According to the CPCB,—a key indicator of sewage contamination—should not exceed the permissible limit of 2,500 units per 100 ml.Faecal coliform bacteria are a group of microorganisms found in the intestines of humans and animals. Their presence in water indicates contamination from sewage or animal waste. While not all coliform bacteria are harmful, their detection raises concerns about the potential presence of dangerous pathogens like viruses, Salmonella, and E. coli.A tribunal panel, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Prakash Shrivastava and comprising Judicial Member Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Expert Member A Senthil Vel, reviewed measures to prevent sewage discharge into the Ganga and Yamuna rivers in Prayagraj. The bench took note of a CPCB report dated February 3, highlighting certain non-compliances and violations.""The river water quality was not conforming to the primary water quality for bathing with respect to faecal coliform (FC) at all the monitored locations on various occasions. A large number of people bathe in the river at Prayagraj during the Mahakumbh Mela, including on auspicious bathing days, which eventually leads to an increase in faecal concentration,"" the report said.The tribunal noted that UPPCB had not submitted a comprehensive action taken report as previously directed, instead providing only a covering letter with water test results.""Even upon reviewing the documents enclosed with the covering letter dated January 28, 2025, sent by the in-charge of the central laboratory, UPPCB, it is reflected that high levels of faecal and total coliform have been found at various locations,"" it continued.The counsel for Uttar Pradesh received one day to examine and respond to the report. The tribunal instructed the UPPCB Member Secretary and relevant state authority responsible for Ganga water quality at Prayagraj to attend the next virtual hearing scheduled for February 19.Speaking to news agency PTI, Jyotish Peeth Shankaracharya Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati said: ""The National Green Tribunal had highlighted this even before the Kumbh started that the quality of Ganga and Yamuna waters was not good for bathing. They had also issued certain directions, especially on controlling the flow drains into the river. 40-50 crore people are taking bath there, it is being advertised all over the world, but the basic facility of clean water for bathing is not being provided.""While in a separate video, a Senior Consultant in Internal Medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi, told news agency ANI: ""We are definitely seeing people with medical problems who are coming back from Kumbh, but obviously in a place which has so many people taking a dip in the water. We would expect that this would happen. The number of people who are coming with medical problems is much less as compared to the volume of people that are going over there.""That way, I think the control is very good, but yes, people are definitely coming with something like what we call gastroenteritis , where they're having loose motions, vomiting, and all that. They're having a fever of unspecific or unspecified origin. Most probably, they're viral fevers that are happening,"" the expert warned.The Senior Consultant said that many people returning from Kumbh are experiencing respiratory tract infections which is a common ailment in crowded settings.""Quite a few people are suffering from respiratory tract infections, like a runny nose, sneezing, cough, and cold, which is obviously very common. When you go to such a crowded place, and then you take a dip, which might be at 3 am in the morning, you can get exposed to this cold,"" he continued.He further advised the ""people to carry their own water, maybe water from home or maybe bottles of water, and they should drink water from a good place or carry their own bottles"".""The second thing is to eat food from a healthy place and eat cooked food rather than raw food, wear a mask and try to keep people at a distance...Do not drink the water while taking a dip in the river,"" the doctor added.",Faecal coliform bacteria are a group of microorganisms found in the intestines of humans and animals.

CEC appointment: Rahul fires 'midnight decision' salvo; BJP questions Cong's past 'pliant picks',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cec-appointment-rahul-fires-midnight-decision-salvo-bjp-questions-congs-past-pliant-picks/articleshow/118361284.cms,"So, why is the new appointment process under judicial scrutiny?

What did Rahul say in his dissent note

'Congress acting like cry baby'

SC hearing tomorrow

NEW DELHI: Gyanesh Kumar will take over as the 26th Chief Election Commissioner tomorrow - on a day the Supreme Court will hear a petition challenging the 2023 law under which his appointment was made by the Centre late on Monday night.The appointment, which is the first under the new law, was made by a selection panel which included Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi . The Congress leader objected to the selection process citing tomorrow's SC hearing and presented a dissenting note to the panel.The Centre's move triggered a war of words between the BJP and the Congress. While the Congress claimed that the midnight appointment by PM and HM was both ""disrespectful and discourteous,"" the BJP asserted that no rules were broken and accused the grand old party of acting like cry babies. The BJP also questioned the appointment of past ECs under the Congress regime and cited how they were rewarded by the grand old party.On March 2, 2023, a five-judge SC bench had directed that a panel comprising the PM, leader of opposition (LoP) and Chief Justice of India would advise the President on appointment of CEC and election commissioners. SC had said its order would hold good until the Centre came up with a law to lay down a mechanism for the selection.The apex court's verdict also held that leaving the appointment of the ECs and CEC in the hands of the executive would be detrimental to the health of the country's democracy and the holding of free and fair elections.After the SC verdict, the Centre notified a new legislation for appointment of CEC and ECs in August 2023 and Parliament passed the Bill in December 2023. Under the Centre's new law the CJI in selection panel was replaced with a Union minister alongside the PM and LoP.This effectively made the Election Commission appointments at the discretion of the government and hence was challenged in the apex court. The petitioners contended that the Election Commission should be insulated from ""political"" and ""executive interference"" for maintaining a healthy democracy.In his dissent note presented before the selection panel, Rahul Gandhi cited the speech of B R Ambedkar while speaking in the Constituent Assembly in June 1949 to discuss the setting up of an independent Election Commission, where he had warned about executive interference in India's democracy and the affairs of the Election Commission.The Congress leader said the SC March 2, 2023 verdict reflected the larger concern among hundreds of millions of voters over the integrity of our electoral process. This is also reflected in public surveys that show a continuing decline in trust of voters in India's election process and its institutions.He further claimed that the government's legislation bypassed the spirit and the letter of the Supreme Court's order. Citing the hearing in apex court, he urged that the process of choosing the next CEC be deferred and the meeting be postponed.The Congress said that by removing the chief justice of India from the selection committee, the government has made it clear it wants control and not to preserve the credibility of the Election Commission.The BJP dismissed Rahul Gandhi's criticism as ""politically motivated"" and accused him of undermining an elected government's constitutional mandate through ""malicious"" judicial activism. BJP's IT department head Amit Malviya said Rahul's dissent on the appointment of the chief election commissioner (CEC) is not just politically motivated but also lacks merit. He also accused the Congress of conveniently misreading and misinterpreting the Supreme Court's judgment on the CEC's appointment.Attacking the Congress, he said the party and the Gandhis, in particular, should be the last to sermonise on the appointment of the CEC, given their record of ""abusing the office, appointing pliant candidates, and later doling out political appointments to incumbents as a reward for their services after stepping down"". The BJP leader also shared a list of several former CECs who were later given different positions or honoured with Padma awards by the then government.BJP leader and Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan also attacked Rahul and said ""Congress Party crushed the Constitution at their convenience to serve their political interests. Congress never left an opportunity to ridicule and insult Baba Saheb Ambedkar, yet the Yuvraj of Congress has the audacity to take a grandstand on upholding Baba Saheb's ideals and that of our founding leaders.""""This latest jig by @RahulGandhi is another attempt to create controversy and peddle propaganda on the appointment of CEC. Has Rahul Gandhi forgotten how ECs were appointed during Congress rule? Despite being in power for decades why did Congress govt do nothing to reform the selection mechanism?"" he asked.The education minister further stated, ""As a matter of fact, this is the first time that CEC has been appointed by a law passed in the Parliament. It is our govt. that has created a joint system for the appointment of CEC and EC, which includes the LoP. It is a great misfortune that Rahul Gandhi and Congress Party are acting like cry babies even when no rule/law is broken"".It will be interesting to see what is the Supreme Court's take on the issue when a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh hears the petitions against the Centre's amended law. The apex court had in January this year said that examining the validity of the 2023 law would boil down to a contest between Parliament's power to legislate on the selection framework and SC's power as a constitutional court.On March 15, 2024, the top court had refused to stay the appointments of the new ECs under the 2023 law.On February 12 this year, the top court had fixed February 19 to hear pleas against the appointment of the CEC and EC under the 2023 law saying if anything happens in the interregnum, the consequences were bound to follow.It had said the issue would be decided on merit.(With inputs from agencies)",Gyanesh kumar will take over as the 26th chief election commissioner tomorrow. The supreme court will hear a petition challenging the 2023 law under which his appointment was made. The centre's move triggered a war of words between the bjp and the congress.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118363170,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-891491,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

There were three women and three children on board who were not cuffed,"" Daljit told news agency PTI upon arrival. His experience reflects the harsh reality of illegal migration , where many fall prey to fraudulent travel agents and endure gruelling journeys, only to be deported back home.Among the deportees, over 60 were from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, two each from Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.Daljit recounted how he was lured by a travel agent in 2022, who promised to take him to the US legally in exchange for Rs 65 lakh. To secure the deal, he handed over an advance agreement for an acre of his land. His journey began in November 2022, when he was first sent to Dubai. After spending nearly 18 months there, he returned to India, only to be sent to South Africa for four-and-a-half months.From there, he was taken to Brazil on August 26 last year and embarked on a treacherous route through multiple countries. The journey involved walking through dense forests, crossing rivers, and surviving on minimal food. Eventually, he reached Mexico, where he was forced to stay for a month while his travel agent coerced his wife into signing over his land. Finally, he crossed into the US on January 27, only to be caught and detained by US Border Patrol. ""I was given only a bottle of water, a packet of chips, and an apple daily,"" he told PTI.Sourav, a 20-year-old from Punjab's Ferozepur district, also shared his harrowing experience. His family spent Rs 45-46 lakh to send him to the US, selling farmland and borrowing money from relatives. ""We were kept in a camp (detention centre) for 18 days,"" he said. ""A day before our deportation, we were told that we would be shifted to another camp. When we boarded the plane, they said we were being taken to India.""Sourav had travelled through Amsterdam, Panama, and Mexico before attempting to cross the border on January 27. ""Our mobile phones were confiscated, and we had no contact with our families. Our hands and legs were tied. We cooperated with the US authorities, but no one heard our appeals.""Harjit Singh, from Gurdaspur district, was deported alongside his cousin.

However, CPCB found that by Jan 19, total coliform levels had reached a whopping 700,000 MPN/100ml in the Ganga and 330,000 MPN/100ml in the Yamuna. It analysed the samples on Jan 12, 13, 14, 15 and 19, and the total coliform levels never met standards.CPCB findings not only indicated non-compliance with NGT's earlier directive to maintain critical water quality standards, but also raised concerns over public health and environmental sustainability, the tribunal's principal bench, headed by its chairperson Justice Prakash Shirvastava, noted during a hearing on Feb 17.The high levels of faecal bacteria in the waters pose significant risks of waterborne diseases, while excessive organic pollution threatens aquatic life and overall river health.Pointing out that UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) had not filed any comprehensive action taken report, as directed by tribunal in Dec last year, the bench ordered the board's member secretary and the state authority responsible for maintaining water quality in river Ganga at Prayagraj to appear before it virtually during the next hearing on Feb 19.NGT had in Dec asked CPCB and UPPCB to monitor and report the water quality regularly, while also ensuring that untreated sewage did not flow into the two rivers so that the pilgrims who came for a holy bath did not suffer. It directed the agencies to analyse water samples from the rivers at least twice a week at regular intervals.In compliance, CPCB submitted its report, which said river water quality did not conform to the bathing criteria at all the monitored locations on various occasions.","The sangam waters where millions of devotees have been taking a holy dip every day during the ongoing maha kumbh has been found to be contaminated with alarming levels of faecal and total coliform.
