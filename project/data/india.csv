DEHRADUN: To include Uttarakhand among the leading states of the country, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has taken up the task of all-around development of the remote villages of the state.CM Dhami directed the officers of the Indian Administrative Service to adopt the villages where they started their service. Under the scheme, the officers have started working for the development of the adopted villages. Many officers have closely understood the life of the villagers and their problems by staying overnight in the villages. After the action plan is made by the officers, the state government will work by running a campaign for the development of villages.CM Dhami had expected the officers of the Indian Administrative Service with grade-pay of Rs 8700 or more to adopt the work area of their first appointment. On this basis, 40 senior IAS officers of the state have adopted their first place of appointment. On May 20, 2025, an order to this effect was also issued by Chief Secretary Anand Bardhan.All the officers were expected to comment on the changes in their first place of appointment area.This means that how fast has the development progressed there as of today and how can the use of CSR or other resources improve the social and economic development of the village. The officers also have to prepare an action plan for 100% correct use of the funds received from the district plan, state sector and finance commission.As per the expectations of Chief Minister Dhami, senior IAS officers have started working in this direction. By preparing a plan for the development of remote villages by the officers, the villages will be developed in a planned manner. The officers are also getting the support of local public representatives and voluntary organisations.","Uttarakhand chief minister pushkar singh dhami has taken up the task of all-around development of the remote villages of the state.

"'Khula' a right, but only courts can issue it: Telangana high court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khula-a-right-but-only-courts-can-issue-it-telangana-high-court/articleshow/122081533.cms,"HYDERABAD: In a significant ruling, Telangana high court has clarified that 'khula' - a form of divorce initiated by Muslim women under Islamic law - is a legitimate right, but must be legally processed only through courts, and not by religious bodies. This ensures legal clarity and enforceability of the divorce, the HC said.A division bench comprising justices Moushumi Bhattacharya and B R Madhusudhan Rao on Tuesday upheld a family court's Feb 2024 ruling in a case where a homemaker had obtained 'khula' from her husband, a businessman. The HC ruled that while 'khula' was indeed a recognised form of divorce under Muslim personal law, religious bodies such as a mufti or sharia council could not issue binding divorce certificates. Only courts, or a qazi officially appointed under the law, had the legal power to declare the end of a marriage, it said.The HC ruling comes close on the heels of a Supreme Court judgment in April this year, which reaffirmed that while a Muslim woman had the right to seek 'khula', it was ultimately the courts, specifically family courts, that had the authority to grant or validate the divorce. The apex court also clarified that while a wife could initiate the process of 'khula', the husband could challenge it in court.In the present case, the husband had challenged the 'khulanama' (divorce certificate) obtained by his wife, arguing that it was granted by a religious body, Sada-e-Haq Sharai Council, which he claimed had no legal authority. The family court, however, upheld divorce, noting proper legal procedures had been followed. The husband filed an appeal against the verdict, but the HC dismissed it.","'khula' is a form of divorce initiated by muslim women under islamic law.

ITR filing last date extension: What happens to penal interest for self-assessment tax?

Penal Interest Implications for Advance Tax

ITR filing last date FY 2024-25: The Income Tax Return filing deadline or last date for FY 2024-25 has been extended by the Income Tax Department this year. Unlike every year, when the last date for ITR filing is July 31, this year it has been extended to September 15, 2025. This extension for ITR filing AY 2025-26 applies to taxpayers whose accounts do not require auditing, including salaried individuals, NRIs, and pensioners.July 31 is generally the due date for self-assessment tax deposits. This tax is the amount payable after accounting for TDS, TCS and advance tax payments. Should taxpayers submit a belated ITR and pay self-assessment tax after the original due date, they become liable for penal interest under Section 234A on the outstanding self-assessment tax, according to an ET report.A significant question arises regarding whether the extension to September 15, 2025, also covers the self-assessment tax payment deadline for FY 2024-2025 (AY 2025-26), allowing taxpayers to avoid penalties.Also Read | ITR e-filing FY 2024-25: What is the benefit of pre-filled ITR forms on the income tax portal? Top points Regarding penal interest applicability post July 31, 2025, Tarun Garg, Director, Deloitte India, tells ET, ""Interest under Section 234A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is applicable when the ITR is filed after the due date as specified under Section 139(1), and the self-assessment tax remains unpaid as of that due date.With the ITR filing due date for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) being extended to 15 September 2025, this revised date will be considered as the ""due date"" for the purposes of Section 234A. ”Interest charges under Section 234A of the Act shall be waived if the requisite tax amount is paid by 15 September 2025. This interpretation aligns with the Supreme Court's judgement in ""CIT vs. Prannoy Roy [309 ITR 231 (2009)]"", and CBDT Circular No. 2/2015, which acknowledged the Court's verdict, Tarun Garg noted.Tarun Kumar Madaan, Practising Chartered Accountant was quoted as saying, ""In the present case, since the due date under Section 139(1) has been extended to 15th September 2025, interest under Section 234A should not be applicable if the ITR is filed, and the entire self-assessment tax is paid, on or before this extended date. In several past instances where the due date for filing the return was extended, the CBDT had expressly clarified that such extension would not apply for the purposes of Section 234A, and interest would still be computed from the original due date. However, Circular No. 6/2025 contains no such caveat. Given that the extension has been granted due to reasons beyond the taxpayer's control (such as non-availability of return filing utilities), it is reasonable to interpret that no interest under Section 234A should be charged if the return is filed by 15th September 2025.""Also Read | ITR e-filing AY 2025-25: What is Annual Information Statement (AIS) and how is it different from Form 26AS? Top points for taxpayers Taxpayers must bear penal interest charges for any shortfall or non-payment of advance tax during FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26). Under Section 234B, penal charges apply when advance tax remains unpaid by specified deadlines. Similarly, Section 234C penalties are enforced when advance tax payments fall below prescribed amounts.The extension of deadlines does not affect the application of penal interest on advance tax deficiencies.Garg says, ""Although the ITR filing deadline has been extended, interest under Sections 234B and 234C of the Act will continue to be applicable.""Madaan says, ""The penal interest under Section 234B and Section 234C is independent of the tax return filing due date and continues to apply where advance tax provisions are not complied with. The extension of the tax return filing due date does not affect the computation or applicability of interest under Section 234B and Section 234C.""Both Sections 234B and 234C carry a penal interest rate of 1% monthly.For self-assessment tax payments made after September 15, 2025 (extended ITR filing deadline), authorities will levy penal interest at a monthly rate of 1%.Also Read | Income Tax Return e-filing: Can you keep switching between new and old tax regime every year?

Yes, absolutely No, they're unnecessary





MUMBAI: Almost one-third of those who have died on the railway lines in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region over the past 15 years have remained unclaimed, an RTI response has revealed.The number of people who remained unidentified after losing their lives in train accidents on the suburban network make up 31% (14,513) of the total people (46,969) who died. They could not be restored to their next of kin despite efforts of the Govt Railway Police (GRP).Data obtained through the RTI plea by orthopaedic Dr Sarosh Mehta shows the percentage of unclaimed bodies started to rise from 2019 onward.Establishing the identity of a railway accident victim is challenging, said police personnel. Sometimes the bodies are mangled beyond recognition and belongings like phones or identity cards are not found.The GRP used to run a website called Shodh, where pictures of unidentified victims were put up along with their details and helped their families find them. But the project was wound up. The GRP also started a campaign where banners with pictures of accident victims were put up at railway stations in a bid to identify them, but passengers found them to be disturbing and they were taken off.""Typically when the victim's identity is not known, the body is kept at a morgue for 15 days to a month. The victim's photograph is sent to police stations across the metropolitan region to find out if a missing complaint has been registered by his/her family. If a claimant does not come forward, then the body is cremated or buried as per the victim's faith (if it is known),"" said a police officer. A piece of clothing or the victim's personal belongings are retained in the police records along with the victim's photo in case his/her family is traced later. Despite challenges, police teams sometimes track down the next of kin through tatoos on the victim's body or tags on his/her clothing.Dr Mehta said often the morgues are full and unclaimed bodies cannot be kept beyond a few days.Between 2002 and 2024, over 72,000 people lost their lives on railway lines due to various reasons, a majority run over while crossing tracks.Data shows overall fatalities have been decreasing every year since 2012. The only exception was 2022 when people stuck at home due to the pandemic started returning to work on the city's lifeline.Dr Mehta said that incidents like track crossing and falling off trains were preventable with measures like boundary walls and closed-door coaches.The Railways have been constructing foot over-bridges and installing escalators to discourage track crossing. But with the number of annual deaths still in four-figures, there is a long way to go to achieve the Railways' mission of zero deaths.","Almost one-third of those who have died on the railway lines in the mumbai metropolitan region over the past 15 years have remained unclaimed.

Family wakes up to surprise visitor in bedroom: A tiger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/family-wakes-up-to-surprise-visitor-in-bedroom-a-tiger/articleshow/122080630.cms,"RANCHI/SILLI/PURULIA/KOLKATA: ""Bhagwan Krishna ne aaj bacha liya (Lord Krishna has saved us today),"" said farmer Puran Chand Mahto (55) of Mardu village in Ranchi district's Silli block, still unable to believe his luck at being alive to tell the tale of how he and his family - his three daughters and a relative, who is a minor - slept peacefully while a tiger silently crouched in a corner of the same room.Around 4.30am Wednesday, Puran was getting ready for the day. As he stepped out of his three-room house into the courtyard, he asked his daughter, Savita, a Class IX student, to bring out the cattle for grazing. Moments later, her shrieks sent a chill down his spine.Savita had found a seven-foot-long tiger inside their room - which had only one door - and screamed: ""Baba, baag... (Father, tiger)!""""All hell broke loose as my two other daughters and the relative were still sleeping inside,"" Puran told TOI over the phone. His wife and son were away to attend a wedding in a nearby village in West Bengal.""Savita rushed inside briefly to wake up the others. I also went in and asked the girls to run to the other side of the room,"" Puran said.""Soon, the tiger jumped into another room through a window that had no grille and stood there. I then asked the girls to run out of the house. As soon as we escaped, we locked the iron door from outside and called for help,"" Puran added.The big cat may have sneaked into the house early in the morning when Puran had gone to the courtyard leaving the door open. Instances of leopards and other wild animals straying into houses had earlier been reported in Jharkhand, but it was the first time that a tiger had strayed into someone's house.The news sent district authorities into a tizzy, and the forest department rushed a team to control the situation. Senior forest officials arrived at the spot to oversee the operation. The house was covered with nets, and prohibitory orders were imposed to check any gathering at the site. A local police officer told TOI that they had roped in additional personnel to prevent any unwanted incident. ""There was a crowd of nearly 1,000 villagers. .. it was a big task for us to ensure their safety,"" the officer said.Around 4pm, a special team from Palamu Tiger Reserve reached the village, and aided by personnel from Ranchi forest division, managed to trap the tiger - a male aged about five years. The team placed a cage, fitted to a rescue van, in front of the door and lured the big cat out. ""Even before placing the bait, the tiger entered the cage and got trapped. It was then tranquillized so that it wouldn't get injured. We had to dart it twice. Around 6.45pm, we left for Ranchi's Bhagwan Birsa Zoo where the tiger will undergo tests,"" an official said.Jharkhand's chief wildlife warden Paritosh Upadhyay said, ""If the tiger is fit, we will release it in a nearby tiger reserve with a radio collar in consultation with the National Tiger Conservation Authority.""The village is located on the banks of the Subarnarekha river, about 60km from Ranchi city and barely 500m from Purulia in West Bengal.

Each one of the stakeholders in the process was aware as to what the offence was, what the crime number was and the sections under which the man was charged with and the punishment section. ""Noting that Aftab was released on Tuesday only after the SC took umbrage to denial of liberty based on a hyper-technicality, the bench said, ""Aftab was sent on a spin and notwithstanding the order of the SC of April 29 (order of a bench headed by the CJI), and the release order of May 27 (by additional sessions and district judge), which is clear to us as daylight, the applicant has been released only on June 24.""Liberty is a very valuable and precious right guaranteed to a person under the Constitution. It cannot be martyred on these useless technicalities. We only hope that no other convict or undertrial is languishing in jail on account of similar technicalities. The DG (prisons) has assured us that no one will suffer because of such technicality in future and that he will sensitise the entire jail staff."" The bench noted that UP prisons had 90,000 inmates.The SC asked the Ghaziabad district judge to complete the inquiry into the episode by Aug 18 and told the DG (prisons) to understand and implement the need to respect court orders and sensitise jail staff about the importance of liberty to ensure such incidents are not repeated.The bench said if it found from the inquiry that jail officials were at fault for delay in Aftab's release despite valid bail orders, it would impose cost on individual officers. It asked the UP govt to pay the compensation of Rs 5 lakh by Friday.UP's advocate general Garima Prasad informed the court that jail authorities had moved the trial court on May 28 for correction in the released order to include Section 5(1) of the anti-conversion law, but the trial court did so only on June 24, following which Aftab was released on Tuesday evening.The SC asked the state not to look for typographical errors in matters relating to liberty and said, ""Otherwise, we (judges) in the SC will be doing proof-reading while most of the country will be behind bars.""","Supreme court orders judicial inquiry into lapses on the part of ghaziabad jail officials.
