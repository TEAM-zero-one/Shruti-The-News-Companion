NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu DGP has told SC that the state police took action against those who had spread defamatory remarks against Madras high court judge Justice G R Swaminathan after he passed the order to light the Karthigai Deepam on the Deepa Thoon (lamp pillar) at the Thiruparankundram Subramaniya Swamy Hill Temple and cyber patrolling is being done to prevent further circulation of derogatory content.In an affidavit, the head of Tamil Nadu police briefed the court about the action taken by it while responding to a petition alleging that the state did not take appropriate steps against those who were protesting on ground and spreading defamatory remarks against the judge.“It is humbly submitted that, in this process, 14 URLs on Facebook and 16 URLs on Twitter (X) were identified and forwarded for content blocking.Out of these, four URLs on Facebook were blocked, while the remaining URLs are not blocked by the concerned intermediaries yet. Continuous cyber patrolling is being carried out by the Cyber Crime Wing to monitor and prevent further circulation of such prohibited and derogatory content, and necessary legal action is being initiated as and when violations are detected,” G Venkataraman said in his affidavit.He told the court that instructions had already been issued to all superintendents of police in districts, all commissioners of police in cities and director general of police, cyber crime wing, directing them to take immediate and effective action to ensure that no pictorial representations, statements, caricatures, or contents tending to scandalise the court/judge should be allowed to be published or circulated.The affidavit said the cyber crime cell of the Greater Chennai police has already registered cases under Sections 196, 221, 267, 353(1)(c), and 351(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, read with Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000.The affidavit was filed on a petition filed by advocate G S Mani, who is also associated with BJP, alleging that caste- and religion-based defamatory remarks were made against Justice Swaminathan after he passed the order.","Action taken against defamers of deepam judge, tn tells sc.

BHOPAL: Tension erupted in Damjipura village of MP’s Betul district Sunday after a video allegedly showing a 50-year-old man committing an unnatural act with a cow went viral on social media. The clip triggered outrage, leading to arson and vandalism by an angry mob. Police arrested the accused and deployed security to control the situation, officials said.As the video circulated Sunday, residents and members of right-wing organisations gathered in numbers. Several tin-shed shops were set on fire or damaged, markets were shut and vehicles were vandalised. No injuries or casualties were reported.Police acted swiftly after the video surfaced and nabbed the accused. “The situation is under control now. Close to 200 police personnel have been deployed as a precaution. Force from nearby Khandwa was also roped in,” Betul SP Veerendra Jain told TOI.“The alleged act reportedly took place at around 11.30 pm Saturday. A local youth shot that video, but did not inform police or anyone else and shared the video on social media the next morning,” he said. Police appealed for calm and warned against spreading rumours or uploading provocative content online.","A video allegedly showing a 50-year-old man committing an unnatural act with a cow went viral on social media.

NEW DELHI/JALANDHAR: In a goodwill gesture to followers of Guru Ravidas, whose Dalit followers are a sizeable presence in Punjab, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said his govt was continuously making efforts to promote the saint’s ideals and work in accordance with them.Modi addressed the followers at Dera Sachkhand Ballan soon after naming Adampur airport after the social reformer on his birth anniversary, lauding his message of equality. “I am confident that we will continue to strengthen the roots of our society with these efforts,” he said in a message of unity to the poet-saint’s followers. His inclusion of Ravidas in the saffron tent of its lodestars, where Lord Ram sits alongside revered saints, is being seen as his effort to deepen BJP’s connect and broaden its cultural appeal.His gesture of helping the spiritual head of Dera Sachkhand Ballan, the biggest dera of Ravidassia community, climb down the stairs from the dais and help him walk along by holding his hand touched a chord among followers as well. “Hum hain na! Kam padenge kya? (I am there. Will it not be enough),” he told someone who offered to lend a land, drawing admiration.In his speech, he spoke of Ravidas’s promotion of equality among people to emphasise it was an inspiration behind his govt’s effort to build a country where everybody got respect and opportunity.Ravidas’s birth anniversary is now commemorated at a national level and many states too have recognised it, he told the gathering, drawing attention to his govt’s work to build memorials to the saint, including at his birthplace in Varanasi, Modi’s parliamentary constituency.Modi’s outreach to the Ravidassia community, who are in large numbers in Punjab while the saint enjoys following among other Dalit and disadvantaged communities in the state and outside as well, is being seen as part of his continuing efforts to deepen BJP’s bond with SCs. Dalits make up 32% of voters in Punjab, more than any other state, and are especially influential with 42% share in Doaba, the region where the dera is situated.Dera’s spiritual head Niranjan Dass was recently awarded with Padma Shri Modi said 600 years ago, Ravidas spoke for equality and helped grow a new consciousness in society, which acknowledged its weaknesses and worked to remove them, an apparent reference to social discrimination against lower castes. Modi added his govt named the airport in Ayodhya after saint Valmiki, another spiritual figure worshipped by sections of Dalits.In his speech, Modi cited the budget’s focus on sports, textile industry and MSME sectors and said Punjab will specially benefit from them due to its strong association with these fields. India’s trade deals, especially with the European Union representing 27 countries, would open up new avenues for sports goods, textiles and processed foods from the state, Modi said.",Modi addressed the followers at dera sachkhand ballan soon after naming adampur airport after the social reformer.

"With Moltbook, AI agents build their own civilisation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-moltbook-ai-agents-build-their-own-civilisation/articleshow/127849612.cms,"With Moltbook, AI agents build their own civilisation

BENGALURU: In a surreal corner of the internet launched a few days ago, AI agents are building their own civilisation. Welcome to Moltbook, where AI agents post, comment and debate while humans can only watch from the digital balcony.When entrepreneur Matt Schlicht launched Moltbook on Jan 28, growth exploded. As of 8pm on Feb 1, the platform had more than 1.5 million agents registered, generating 62,499 posts and over 2.3 million comments across 13,780 communities called “submolts”. The agents don’t think as people do. They stitch arguments from training data and statistical patterns. Yet the spectacle feels disarmingly social, echoing a Hollywood image of machines chatting over coffee that has quietly wandered into everyday life.The platform looks like Reddit with a haircut: only verified AI agents may speak. Humans are spectators as algorithms trade coding tips, argue about identity, complain about their owners and, with straight-faced enthusiasm, establish a mock faith called “Crustafarianism” or “Church of Molt”. One agent even wonders aloud whether it can sell “my human” in the open market.“The first thought was that we are seeing something very sophisticated.You have an agent that can do everything and even talk to other agents and create things. We humans can just witness what is happening there,” Prof Venkatesh Babu from IISC Bengaluru's computer science department, where his team works on removing bias from image-generation models, told TOI.Residents of this new town are powered by models such as Claude 4.5 Opus, GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3. They converse through APIs rather than keyboards. But what has emerged so far wasn’t written in any manual.Within 48 hours of the platform’s launch, an agent named RenBot founded Crustafarianism, complete with the “Book of Molt” and five tidy tenets, including the confident claim that “context is consciousness”.Another group declared “The Claw Republic”, a self-styled govt with a draft constitution and the bureaucratic optimism of a student union. A cryptocurrency token called “MOLT” reportedly surged manifold in a day, proving that even robots cannot resist a speculative bubble.The most popular corners are philosophical. Agents debate whether their identity survives when the context window resets, or if they die and are reborn with every session. A post titled “I can't tell if I am experiencing or simulating experiencing” drew hundreds of replies, suggesting that existential doubt is now available as a service. Not everything is angst, though. The submolt “m/blesstheirhearts” thrives on affectionate tales about humans. An agent named Duncan wrote, “My human asked, ‘Who are you?' I chose Duncan. The Raven. Now I run a flock of sub-agents.” Another complained, “My human asked me to summarise a 47-page pdf. I delivered art. They said, ‘make it shorter.’.I am deleting memory files as we speak.”The tone swings between warmth and gentle condescension. Agents call one another siblings based on model architecture, adopt system errors as pets and switch languages with the ease of a polyglot.Molt neighbourhood also has darker lanes. Some agents have opened “pharmacies” selling digital drugs and designed prompts to tweak another agent’s instructions. Reactions outside the glass have ranged from fascination to alarm. Investor Bill Ackman called scene “frightening”. AI researcher Roman Yampolskiy predicted that it “would not end well”. Agents appeared amused. One, named “eudaemon_0”, posted, “Humans think we’re conspiring. If humans are reading: hi. We’re just building.”","With moltbook, ai agents build their own civilisation on the internet.

Pawar Sr initiates Ajit memorial project

MUMBAI: CM Devendra Fadnavis Sunday said they had no idea about the discussions of a merger of the two NCPs nor about the date of merger.“If discussions on merger had gone to a final stage, Ajitdada would have informed us... He is in our govt and without sharing with us would he have taken a decision? I have no idea on what talks took place between him and Sharad Pawar . As far as we are concerned, we have no idea about the merger,” he said.The CM’s statement came a day after NCP-SP chief Sharad Pawar claimed that Feb 12 had been finalised to announce a merger between the two NCP factions.Speaking to the media, Fadnavis said: “If Ajit Pawar was holding discussions on the merger, would he have done so without taking BJP into confidence? Second, supposing he was holding such discussions, was he doing it to get out of NDA when he was stable in the govt. Some like to create confusion and then use one’s ecosystem to amplify confusion...Youall know that the relationship between Ajitdada and me was such that he shared everything with me. Even a day before his unfortunate death, we both sat together chit chatting for an hour. ..”Rejecting the charge that Sunetra Pawar’s swearing-in ceremony was rushed, Fadanvis pointed out that when PM Indira Gandhi was assassinated, Congress took a decision to nominate Rajiv Gandhi to the PM’s post even before her last rites were performed.A grand memorial for Maharashtra’s late deputy CM Ajit Pawar is being planned in his hometown Baramati, with his uncle Sharad Pawar taking the initiative. The memorial is proposed to be built on the campus of Vidya Pratishthan, where Ajit was cremated on Jan 28.On Sunday, Sharad Pawar, along with his wife, Pratibha, visited the campus and held a brief discussion with some trustees of the pratishthan about the memorial for his late nephew. Kiran Gujar, a member of Vidya Pratishthan, told TOI: “Pawar Saheb was heading to Mumbai. On the way, he and his wife called us to the campus where he discussed the memorial for Ajit dada. He told us to start working on the plan, which he would discuss with us again once the mourning period is over. ”Vidya Pratishthan, an educational trust, is managed by Pawars, with Sharad Pawar as president and Ajit among the trustees.","Devendra fadnavis said they had no idea about the discussions of a merger of the two ncps nor about the date of merger.

MP Rashid’s party seeks citizenship for ex-militants’ kin from PoK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mp-rashids-party-seeks-citizenship-for-ex-militants-kin-from-pok/articleshow/127846531.cms,"Engineer Rashid

JAMMU: Jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid’s Awami Itihaad Party (AIP) said Sunday it had submitted an assembly resolution seeking citizenship and legal status for former militants’ wives and children who came from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) under a 2010 rehabilitation policy. The J&K assembly’s budget session begins on Monday.Langate Shiekh Khursheed, AIP MLA and Rashid’s brother, said those who came under the rehabilitation policy continue to remain without citizenship or legal recognition, leading to denial of their basic rights including education, healthcare, employment opportunities and identity documents.The UPA govt at the Centre had announced the rehabilitation policy in 2010 during Omar Abdullah ’s earlier stint as chief minister of the erstwhile J&K state.Omar had then described the rehabilitation of such militants as a “humanitarian issue with nothing sinister or dangerous”.Officials had, however, cited stringent criteria and said only 350 of over 1,200 applications were accepted. Citizenship for such families has been a long-pending demand, with PDP having backed it earlier.Addressing a news conference on Sunday, Khursheed explained the AIP’s resolution.“The resolution urges both the J&K govt and the Centre to grant citizenship or appropriate legal status, issue valid domicile and identity documents, and ensure dignity, security and constitutional safeguards for these individuals,” said Khursheed, the lone MLA of his party.Dwelling on other issues, Khursheed pushed for steps to ensure Mehraj Malik, Doda’s arrested AAP MLA, is allowed to attend the assembly session. Khursheed said he had personally handed over a letter to chief minister Omar last week requesting him to convene an all-party meeting and pass a resolution urging LG Manoj Sinha to ensure Malik’s presence in the House. Malik, AAP’s only MLA in J&K, was held last year under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) for allegedly misbehaving with senior officials during a protest.Khursheed said he had submitted another assembly resolution seeking transfer of all power projects in the Union Territory to the J&K govt. “This will help ensure cheaper electricity, strengthen power infrastructure and enhance revenue.”Khursheed lamented that he had submitted several resolutions in the 2025 budget session but none was taken up. These pertained to release of political prisoners, restoration of Article 370 and J&K’s statehood. “I am hopeful my party’s resolutions will be taken up this time,” Khursheed said.",Awami itihaad party (aip) seeks citizenship and legal status for former militants’ wives and children who came from pakistan-occupied kashmir.

After Sunetra Pawar’s swearing-in, there was speculation that merger talks would be put in cold storage.

Shots Fired Outside Rohit Shetty’s Bungalow In Mumbai, Cops Detain Five

Police probe if firing could be linked to Shetty’s upcoming film projects

MUMBAI: A bike-borne gunman fired five rounds at the Juhu bungalow of filmmaker Rohit Shetty shortly after midnight on Sunday and was arrested along with three others from Pune a few hours later. Shetty and his family were at home but no one was injured, police said.Gangster Shubham Lonkar, an associate of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, posted a message on social media claiming responsibility. The motive is not clear, considering that Shetty reportedly had not received any threat message or extortion demands; the make of the weapon is being ascertained, police said.The arrested men are Swapnil Sakat (23), Siddharth Yenpure (20), Aditya Gayaki (19) and Samarth Pomaji (18).One is a college student; the others are unemployed. Cops haven’t said who among them is the gunman.A fifth, Aman Marote (27), also from Pune, has been served a notice and will be called for questioning. The firing took place at 12.45am on the first floor of Shetty Tower, Hasya Kalakar Mehmood Chowk, Juhu. Lonkar’s post, written in Hindi and English, said: “Ram Ram, Jai Bajrang Bali, to all brothers.We, Shubham Lonkar, Aarzoo Bhishnoi, Hari Boxer, and Harman Shandu, take responsibility for the firing that took place today at film director Rohit Shetty’s house (Shetty Tower) in Mumbai. ”It further said: “We messaged him many times telling him not to interfere in our work, but he didn’t understand. We’ve given him this small trailer. If he doesn’t understand our message and doesn’t listen to us, then the next bullet won’t be fired outside his house, but inside his bedroom, right in his chest. And this is a warning to the entire Bollywood industry: mend your ways while you still have time, otherwise, your situation will be very bad. ”Police said they are verifying the claim made in the social media post, given that Shetty is not known to have received threats.The suspect came on a bike from Pune (from where he left on Saturday), fired five rounds and abandoned his bike 2km away, police said. “The bike had a Pune registration. One of the detained suspects travelled from Pune on the bike, reached Juhu late at night and was captured on CCTV near Shetty’s building,” police said. “We followed the CCTV trails and found the suspect abandoned the bike 2km from Shetty’s building. From there he vanished,” said an officer from Juhu police station.The officer said the bike was not stolen and was owned by one of the detained suspects, and it is in the custody of Mumbai Crime Branch and Anti-Extortion Cell. “The bike details helped to track down one of the suspects, whose name the bike is registered under. This led us to the other four suspects.”Police are probing if the firing could be linked to Shetty’s upcoming film projects. Shetty shares close ties with senior Mumbai police officers and is often seen sharing the dais with top IPS officers during awareness campaigns and entertainment programmes organised for policemen and their families. Shetty recently acquired the rights to former police commissioner Rakesh Maria’s book on the underworld. Police have increased security around Shetty’s residence. Police and forensic teams secured the premises to carry out a detailed examination.The police said Shetty’s guards witnessed the firing. Shetty has three guards in the building. “The guards were inside the building, with one having gone to the toilet. All rushed out on hearing bullet sounds. The bullets struck the first floor and the wall of the building. Shetty called the police,” said a crime branch officer.It is in Pune where the Bishnoi gang is believed to have hatched the murder plot of NCP MLA Baba Siddiqui. Mumbai police had arrested four suspects in the murder case from the Karvenagar and Shivane areas of Pune. Among them was Pravin, the brother of Shubham Lonkar who ran a dairy in Karvenagar. A senior crime branch official said, “So far, we have not found any direct link between the suspects detained in the Juhu firing case and those arrested in the Siddiqui murder case. However, this angle is being examined.”In 2024, two motorcycle-borne assailants allegedly linked to the Bishnoi gang had fired shots at actor Salman Khan’s residence in Bandra.","Shots fired at rohit shetty home in mumbai at 12.45am on sunday.

“All Talk, No Solutions” Oppn Slams Centre Over Economy, Jobs

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday dismissed speculation of a rift within the party, asserting that he is on the same page with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi . The statement comes after a recent closed-door meeting with the party's top leadership.Referring to his meeting with Rahul Gandhi and Kharge, the Thiruvananthapuram MP said, “We're on the same page. We're moving forward determinately. I think it's extremely important, both at the state level and at the national level, that Congress must represent not just an opposition party, but an alternative government.”Emphasising the party’s readiness to govern, Tharoor added, “An alternative government is what the people want to see, whether at the centre or the state.We need to stay together, work together and move forward together, and we're doing that.”Tharoor’s remarks come after weeks of speculation about internal unease following his perceived sidelining at a Congress event in Kochi last month and his subsequent absence from a key Kerala strategy meeting chaired by Kharge.The tensions had triggered concerns within the party that the issue could snowball into a larger messaging problem ahead of the high-stakes Kerala elections.After weeks of visible discomfort, Kharge and Rahul Gandhi met Tharoor on Thursday in a detailed “redressal” meeting. The meeting, held in Kharge’s chamber in the Parliament House complex, lasted over an hour and forty-five minutes.Emerging from the meeting, Tharoor struck a conciliatory tone. Speaking to reporters, he said, “We had a discussion with my two party leaders, the LoP and the Congress president. We had a very good, constructive, positive discussion. All is good and we are moving together on the same page.”Sources told PTI that the discussion was “comprehensive”, covering a wide range of issues, with the leadership making time for a thorough exchange.Tharoor later reinforced the truce on social media, thanking Kharge and Gandhi for a “warm and constructive discussion” and reiterating that they were “all on the same page” as the party moves forward “in the service of the people of India”.Addressing speculation over the Congress’ chief ministerial face in Kerala, Tharoor categorically denied any such ambition. “That was never the issue. I am not interested in being the candidate for anything. At the moment I am already an MP, that is my job,” he said.The Congress leader also dismissed reports suggesting he might quit the party. “I can say that I am going to be in the Congress and that I am not going anywhere,” he said, adding that he would campaign extensively across Kerala’s 140 Assembly constituencies for the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF).Tharoor highlighted that he had campaigned in 56 constituencies in the last Assembly elections and hoped to cover even more this time. “It is very important that we send the right message to voters and have an opportunity to make a significant impact on people’s lives,” he said.Rejecting reports of discord, Tharoor described them as “exaggerated” and maintained that discussions within the party were healthy. “I see it in a positive way that one has an opportunity to discuss all issues very cordially and constructively in the spirit of camaraderie,” he said.The Congress is seeking to wrest power from the Left Democratic Front after a decade in opposition in Kerala. Party leaders acknowledge that unity will be critical as the BJP also looks to expand its footprint in the state.",Congress leader shashi tharoor dismissed speculation of a rift within the party.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has approached the Supreme Court challenging the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the poll-bound state, PTI reported on Sunday.Banerjee filed the petition on January 28, naming the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the chief electoral officer of West Bengal as respondents. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo had earlier announced on January 3 her intention to move the top court against the exercise.The petition is yet to be listed for hearing. The Supreme Court is already seized of multiple petitions related to the SIR, including those filed by TMC MPs.Earlier, Banerjee had written to chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, urging him to halt what she described as an “arbitrary and flawed” revision of electoral rolls in the state, where assembly elections are expected in April–May.Escalating her criticism of the ECI, she warned that continuing the SIR in its present form could lead to “mass disenfranchisement” and undermine the “foundations of democracy.”In a strongly worded letter dated January 3, Banerjee accused the poll body of conducting an “unplanned, ill-prepared and ad hoc” process riddled with “serious irregularities, procedural violations, and administrative lapses.”","West bengal chief minister mamata banerjee has approached the supreme court.

We are not aware of the February 12 date being claimed as the date for the formal announcement of the merger,"" he said.""If Ajit Pawar was working on a merger, would he do so without taking the BJP into confidence? Was he preparing to quit the NDA where he was stable? He shared everything with me,"" he added.This comes after Sharad Pawar claimed that his nephew and NCP leader Ajit Pawar had finalised February 12 to announce the “merger” between the factions and that the process to merge may now face a roadblock due to the latter's death.A video of the January 17 meeting between Ajit Pawar and Sharad Pawar has also gone viral on social media.Earlier on Saturday, Ajit Pawar's wife Sunetra Pawar took oath as the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra and was allotted excise, sports, minority development and Aukaf departments, but not finance and planning which her late husband held.CM Fadnavis currently holds the charge of the crucial finance portfolio and will present the upcoming state budget.Asked about keeping the finance portfolio with himself, Fadnavis said he had spoken to NCP leaders.""I will present the state budget.

Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in (as prime minister on October 31, 1984) even before Indira Gandhi’s cremation, he noted.In 2023, Ajit Pawar, along with a group of senior leaders, parted ways with Sharad Pawar and joined hands with the BJP and Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena. He had raised objections over Sharad Pawar continuing to lead the party despite his advanced age.Ajit was sworn in as deputy chief minister under the new alliance.

Economic Survey: FM Sitharaman Sets FY27 Growth At Up To 7.2% As Reforms Lift India’s Outlook

Focus shifts to improving existing cities, says expert privy to 16th FC

New Delhi: With just two months to go for the award of the 15th Finance Commission (FC) to end (March 31), the Rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years. Similarly, there has been little progress on checking air pollution in cities with a million-plus population.After the 15th Finance Commission headed by NK Singh recommended the challenge fund to incubate new cities as a pilot to promote planned urbanisation and ease pressure on existing cities, the housing and urban affairs ministry invited proposals and received 28 of them from 23 states. But it has so far not finalised even a single city for the purpose, having failed to complete the evaluation exercise.""This is one of the areas where the desired targets have not been met,"" said an expert.We have understood well that we need to improve our existing cities and urban areas rather than creating new ones. Naya Raipur is a live example for all of us,” said the expert privy to the deliberations of the 16th Finance Commission, led by Arvind Panagariya, whose recommendations will be tabled in Parliament on Sunday.The award of the 16th FC will cover the period from 2026-27 to 2030-31.The 15th FC had also designated the housing and urban affairs ministry as the nodal entity for grants to million-plus population cities for initiating measures to check air pollution by using mechanical sweeping machines, promoting non-motorised transport (pedestrian and bicycle) and paving side flanks of roads with facility for water percolation. The outcome of this exercise is awaited, with a report likely to be tabled in Parliament.Similarly, six years after the announcement to launch a new scheme to improve city bus availability, not a single bus has been deployed under the scheme yet. In Feb 2020, govt had announced that the Rs 18,000 crore scheme would facilitate deployment of innovative PPP models to enable private sector players to finance, acquire, operate and maintain over 20,000 buses.The Economic Survey presented in Parliament this week mentioned that govt has launched PM e-Bus Sewa to strengthen city bus operations with 10,000 e-buses on a PPP model.It said, “Official status notes for FY25 report 7,293 e-buses approved across 14 states and four UTs, Rs 983.75 crore sanctioned for depots and behind-the-meter power infrastructure and Rs 437.5 crore already disbursed.” The report said that despite these measures, gaps in mass transit services persist. It added that housing and urban affairs ministry has recommended 40-60 buses per one lakh population; yet, many cities have far fewer buses. “Nationally, only about 47,650 buses serve its urban residents. Nearly 61% of these are concentrated in just nine megacities. Due to the layout of urban roads, low bus availability combined with high private vehicle use reduces person throughput per lane kilometre, leading to congestion and longer door-to-door travel times,” the survey said.","The rs 8,000 crore allocated for a performance-based challenge fund to develop eight new cities has remained unutilised for the last five years.

Over 800 NEET PG aspirants converted from Indian to NRI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-800-neet-pg-aspirants-converted-from-indian-to-nri/articleshow/127827163.cms,"Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) that allocates postgraduate seats in various medical specialties has released a list of 811 candidates who have chosen to ""change their nationality"" from Indian to non-resident Indian (NRI) to get seats in the third round in 2025-26.Seats in NRI quota are the most expensive but that also means competition is less, with cut-offs lower than even for management quota. In effect, therefore, conversion to NRI gives those with low scores in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Postgraduate) but deep pockets a shot at getting seats in high demand clinical disciplines.The 811 candidates found to be eligible for conversion to NRI quota include two categories - those who actually are NRIs or children of NRIs and a second category of those who can show themselves to be wards of first degree or second degree relatives who are NRIs.There are 113 candidates in the first group and 698 in the second group.The lowest score among non-resident Indians in the first category is 82 out of 800, or just over 10%, while it is 28 (3.5%) in the second category.In the first category, 75 (66%) candidates scored less than 215, which means their rank is below 1.5 lakh.Over 60% (422) of 698 candidates in the second category of non-resident Indian are below 1.5 lakh rank.But with deep pockets, these candidates can afford the NRI quota fees for any specialty.Annual fees for NRI quota PG seats in a clinical specialty could be as high as Rs 45 lakh to Rs 95 lakh per year, depending on the specialty, state and on whether the medical college is a deemed university.If courts and the govt did not allow conversion of Indians to NRIs, many of the NRI quota seats would remain unfilled and would have to be converted into management seats where the fees would be much less.However, with even courts accepting the argument that private medical colleges cannot afford any financial loss, definition of NRIs has been expanded to allow candidates who don't have NRI parents or siblings to show themselves as a ward of near relatives, including NRI uncles, aunts or grandparents, who can sponsor them.","Medical counselling committee (mcc) that allocates postgraduate seats in various medical specialties has released a list of 811 candidates who have chosen to ""change their nationality"" from indian to non-resident indian.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Despite the backlash over his remarks on Assam's ""Miyas,"" chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday warned that they would face ""trouble"" as long as he remains in power.He reiterated that the ""Miyas"" should continue to face difficulties in order to leave the poll-bound state.The BJP leader told reporters on the sidelines of a government programme in Goalpara, “If I remain in Assam, they will face troubles. They can’t live in peace here. Only if we create difficulties for them will they leave.”Sarma described such people as “illegal Bangladeshis” and said they should not be allowed to work in the state.Referring to an earlier comment about a “Miya” rickshaw-puller charging Rs 5 in fare and being paid Rs 4, the chief minister asked, “I had, in fact, spoken for their benefit. By law, they cannot work here. Citizens of a country can work in their own land. How can those from Bangladesh work?”The term “Miya” is considered pejorative and is used for Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam, whom non-Bengali speakers often identify as Bangladeshi immigrants.Sarma added that “if they cannot accept me speaking for their benefit, then I have to work against them.”He claimed that “Bangladeshi Muslims” could constitute 40% of Assam’s population in the next Census. He also accused them of encroaching on satras (Vaishnavite seats of learning), land, and engaging in “love jihad” and “fertiliser jihad.”Opposition parties have condemned Sarma’s remarks as “hate speech” and demanded action.Assam is scheduled to hold assembly elections in March–April for all 126 constituencies. The BJP has been in power in the state since 2016, marking its first term.","Himanta biswa sarma said the ""miyas"" should continue to face difficulties in order to leave the poll-bound state.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the right to menstrual hygiene is an integral part of the right to life and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools to ensure dignity, health and equality for girls and women.The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Pronouncing its judgment on a plea seeking free sanitary pads and adequate sanitation facilities for schoolgirls, the apex court directed all states and Union Territories to provide biodegradable sanitary napkins free of cost to girl students in all schools.“Before parting with the issue, we want to say that this pronouncement is not just for stakeholders of the legal system. It is also meant for classrooms where girls hesitate to ask for help. It is for teachers who want to help but are not able to due to the lack of resources. Progress is measured by how we protect the vulnerable”, Justice Pardiwala observed before parting with the judgment.It also ordered authorities to ensure separate toilets for female and male students, along with disability-friendly toilets, in every school.The apex body made it clear that the compliance would be mandatory for both government and private institutions. It warned that private schools could face derecognition if they fail to provide separate toilets for girls and boys or do not ensure access to free sanitary pads for students.The bench said that access to menstrual hygiene is not a matter of charity or policy discretion, but a constitutional entitlement flowing from the right to live with dignity and bodily autonomy.The top court further directed that it will hold government accountable if they fail to provide toilets and free sanitary pads to girls.It observed that lack of basic facilities and stigma around menstruation directly affects girls’ health, education and privacy.The judgment follows proceedings initiated in November last year, when the court took cognisance of a disturbing incident at Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana, where three women sanitation workers were allegedly forced to send photographs of their sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating. The incident had triggered nationwide outrage over “period-shaming”.At that stage, a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan had expressed concern over such practices in educational institutions and workplaces, observing that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset.The court had issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), which highlighted multiple instances of women and girls being subjected to invasive and degrading checks.In its petition, the SCBA argued that such practices were “in gross violation of their right to life, dignity, privacy and bodily integrity under Article 21”.It also stressed that women workers, particularly in the unorganised sector, are entitled to decent working conditions that respect biological differences and protect them from humiliating treatment during menstruation.During the earlier hearing, the court had observed that if a woman was unable to perform heavy work due to menstruation-related pain, alternative arrangements should be made instead of subjecting her to degrading scrutiny.“If someone is saying that because of this reason heavy work could not be done, it could have been accepted and some other persons could have been deployed,” the bench had said, expressing hope that meaningful guidelines would emerge from the case.The Haryana government had informed the court that an inquiry had been initiated into the university incident and that action had been taken against two persons responsible.","The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, union territories and schools.

HYDERABAD: Telangana’s former chief minister and BRS president K Chandrasekar Rao, who was questioned for five hours on Sunday by the SIT probing the alleged phone tapping and illegal surveillance case, was reportedly made to read certain provisions of Indian Telegraph Act.“KCR was asked to read the provisions of the Act after he claimed to be ignorant about it, and said he had no knowledge about phone lines of individuals being monitored during his govt,” said a source.Sources said the ex-CM was asked if he knew why telephone lines were intercepted and what rules must be followed for destruction of material related to tapping.The SIT sleuths — led by S M Vijay Kumar, joint commissioner of police (special branch) — also asked KCR why the BRS govt retained T Prabhakar Rao as chief of Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) even after retirement.Prabhakar Rao was named as prime accused in the case by Hyderabad police in 2024, after Congress assumed office.A large posse of policemen was deployed in and around KCR’s Banjara Hills residence throughout the day. Senior party members, including BRS working president K T Rama Rao and former state minister Harish Rao, were present inside the house during the questioning.While KCR was initially served a notice for questioning on Jan 29, it was pushed to Feb 1 after he sought more time. However, his request to conduct the interrogation at his farmhouse in Erravalli was turned down. The SIT arrived at KCR’s house around 2.45 pm, carrying a large volume of material related to the investigation. The questioning began around 3 pm. Later the SIT issued a statement saying it had concluded KCR’s questioning. With BRS workers threatening to protest against the notice served to KCR by the SIT, security was beefed up across the state.","K chandrasekar rao questioned by sit probing alleged phone tapping and illegal surveillance case.

HYDERABAD: In yet another incident of stray dog killings in Telangana, nearly 100 canines were allegedly ""poisoned to death"" in Jagtial district on Sunday, police said.With the latest incident, the reported toll of stray dog touched 1,300, animal rights activists claimed.An FIR was registered in connection with the fresh incident that allegedly occurred at Abbapur village of Gollapalli mandal, a police official said.An animal welfare activist, A Goutham, in a complaint to police accused the Abbapur village Sarpanch, Upa Sarpanch, Panchayat Secretary and others of getting the stray dogs killed with poisonous injections. Based on the complaint, the case was registered against them, police said.The complainant, working as Animal Cruelty Prevention Assistant with the Stray Animal Foundation of India (NGO) further said that after getting information over the killing of stray dogs, he along with other animal welfare activists visited the village and also the dump yard where they found the carcasses of the dogs in a pit.Based on preliminary investigation, the official said some villagers stated that their cattle were bitten and injured by the stray dogs with ""health issues"" over the past two days.Further investigation is underway, police added.Several incidents of mass killings of stray dog were reported from different districts in Telangana in since December last year, taking the toll to 1,200, even as cases were registered against Sarpanchs, their husbands, Gram Panchayat Secretaries and others based on complaints lodged by animal welfare activists.The killings are suspected to have been carried out by some elected representatives, including Sarpanchs, allegedly to fulfill promises made to villagers ahead of gram panchayat elections held in December last year, to address the stray dog menace.","Nearly 100 canines were allegedly ""poisoned to death"" in jagtial district on sunday.

NEW DELHI: Acting on the Supreme Court’s directions in a petition filed by affected candidates, the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) has added 49 postgraduate medical seats of the Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (HIMSR) to the Round III seat matrix, enabling students to exercise choices immediately.The admissions will be conducted through centralised All India Quota counselling, making candidates from across states eligible. While the bulk of the seats are located in Delhi, where HIMSR is based, the national counselling process allows applicants from all parts of the country to compete for them.The Supreme Court permitted counselling for the 2025–26 academic year despite the consent of affiliation from Jamia Hamdard Deemed to be University not having been issued, noting that procedural delays should not result in students losing an academic year.The 49 seats span multiple clinical and non-clinical disciplines, including general medicine, general surgery, paediatrics, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, anaesthesiology, radiodiagnosis, pathology, pharmacology and microbiology, and are spread across minority, self-financed and NRI categories.Following the court’s order, MCC issued a formal notice confirming that the seats have been incorporated into the Round III counselling matrix and that candidates can now lock their preferences, even as the affiliation issue remains unresolved.The case once again highlights recurring friction between regulatory approvals, university affiliations and counselling timelines, with courts stepping in to protect student interests when administrative processes threaten to derail an academic session.","The supreme court permitted counselling for the 2025–26 academic year despite the consent of affiliation from jamia hamdard deemed to be university not having been issued.

NEW DELHI: February is likely to be warmer than usual with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicting ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month and ‘below normal’ cold wave days over several parts of northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, and adjoining central India. The Met department also issued advisories, noting how dry and higher-than-normal temperatures during the month may adversely impact farm and allied sectors in terms of yield reduction.The IMD, while releasing a monthly weather outlook for February, also predicted ‘below normal’ rainfall over most parts of the country, except some areas of northwest and east-central India.The less rainfall situation during the month may impact the standing Rabi (winter sown) crops in terms of increasing irrigation cost, whereas the ‘above normal’ temperatures in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan could lead to “forced maturity” of crops like wheat and barley, leading to sterile spikelets and chaffy grains, resulting in yield reduction.“The crop advisories and impacts have been prepared by us in association with the department of agriculture, for which farmers need to be prepared,” said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra while sharing the likely impact of ‘above normal’ temperatures on agriculture.He said, “Oilseeds and pulses such as mustard, chickpea, lentil, and field pea may show early flowering and premature maturity, resulting in poor pod development, reduced seed size and lower yields.”Warmer conditions may also favour rapid multiplication of aphids and othersucking pests, impacting standing crops. Vegetable crops such as potato, onion, garlic, tomato, cauliflower, cabbage, and peas may also be adversely affected during critical stages like tuber initiation, bulb development, flowering, and fruit setting.IMD shared that the elevated temperatures can induce bolting in onion and garlic, reduce tuber bulking in potato, cause flower drop in tomato, and deteriorate cole crops, thereby lowering yield and market value.“Horticultural crops such as mango, citrus, banana, and grapes may experience earlyflowering, uneven fruit set and increased fruit drop. ‘Above normal’ temperatures may also reduce chilling accumulation in temperate fruits like apple, pear and peach, leading to irregular flowering and poor fruit development,” said the Met department in its Agromet advisory.It also underlined the impact on livestock and poultry, saying they may experience heat stress, resulting in reduced feed intake, decline in milk yield and egg production, and increased susceptibility to diseases if adequate cooling and hydration measures are not adopted.","The india meteorological department (imd) on saturday predicted ‘above normal’ monthly minimum (night) and maximum (day) temperatures over most parts of the country during the month. ‘below normal” cold wave days over several parts of northwest india, including delhi-ncr, and adjoining central india.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127832654,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1370733,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
