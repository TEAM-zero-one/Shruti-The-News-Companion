Extreme monsoon may lead to dip in sea fish catch: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extreme-monsoon-may-lead-to-dip-in-sea-fish-catch-study/articleshow/120710761.cms,"Global warming is expected to bring stronger and more unpredictable monsoons to the region. How might these changes affect fish life in the Indian Ocean? A team of researchers tried to answer this question by looking at what happened in the deep past, through evidence left behind in plankton shells dating back 22,000 years on the seabed of the Bay of Bengal. What they found is not reassuring.Monsoon extremes over the past 10-20,000 years led to disruptions in ocean ecosystems and a crash in marine productivity in the Bay of Bengal, showed their study, published in Nature on Monday. Combining these historical patterns with climate projections, researchers found that intense monsoons caused by global warming could result in similar disruptions in marine productivity in the future.""We argue that as the monsoon becomes stronger and more variable, productivity collapses,"" said Kaustubh Thirumalai, the study's lead author and a scientist at the University of Arizona. That's important, he notes, because although the Bay of Bengal covers less than 1% of ocean area, it generates almost 8% of global fishery production. ""The hilsa fishery by itself sustains the protein needs of one of the most densely populated regions in the world,"" he said.For the study, researchers analysed fossilised foraminifera, microscopic single-cell zooplankton that hold a record of environmental conditions in their calcium carbonate shells to reconstruct the history of the Indian summer monsoon. Interestingly, they found that both extremes of rainfall - low and high - led to similar disruptions in ocean ecosystems, suggesting that marine productivity depends on a specific range of environmental conditions.Weak monsoons occurred in a cold phase between 17,500 and 15,000 years ago, while strong monsoons occurred during a period of warming in the early Holocene around 10,000 years ago. Marine productivity declined in both periods.How does monsoon rainfall over land influence ocean processes? One way is through river runoff which brings fresh water from the Ganga and other rivers into the Bay of Bengal. This fresh water forms a layer on the surface of the ocean, preventing the mixing of water. ""If the water doesn't mix, you don't have nutrients replenishing the surface ocean, the sunlit part of the ocean where plankton photosynthesise,"" said Thirumalai. Plankton are the foundation of the ocean's food chain.Warmer oceans - and the Indian Ocean is already warming - can also increase this ""stratification"" of water layers, and prevent the mixing of nutrients-rich waters. ""Climate projections under future boundary conditions show stronger monsoon rainfall, warmer surface waters, and weaker winds - all conditions that echo the past extremes we studied,"" said Tirumalai.The new study is a collaboration between scientists from US, India, and Europe.Another study, from researchers at the Central University of Kerala published last week, came up with similar findings through the analysis of sediments from the Andaman Sea as well as the Bay of Bengal.","Monsoon extremes over the past 10-20,000 years led to disruptions in ocean ecosystems and a crash in marine productivity in the bay of bengal.

Kolkata court frees murder accused after 8 yrs in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kolkata-court-frees-murder-accused-after-8-yrs-in-jail/articleshow/120710641.cms,"Representative image

KOLKATA: A Kolkata court acquitted last week a 31-year-old man who spent eight years behind bars for the murder of a friend, sharply criticising police for failing to send key evidence for forensic testing and mishandling the investigation.Kolkata resident Raja Paik , arrested in Sept 2017 for the murder of 24-year-old Chiranjib Gupta in the city, was cleared Thursday by Alipore sessions judge Surajit Mandal.Chiranjib's mother said in the police complaint that her son - a drug addict and habitual drunkard - was found dead with a pillow on his face on the first floor of their two-storey home at Eastend Park in Garfa area when she returned home at 6.30pm after buying medicine for her daughter. Her daughter, returning from school at 3pm, said Chiranjib had opened the door for her.The judge faulted police for not sending the bloodstained pillow and a cotton belt - the alleged murder weapons - for forensic examination .""That aspect creates a doubt with respect to the manner in which the investigation has been handled,"" Mandal said. He also expressed surprise that the cotton belt, cited by police as a key weapon, was similarly ignored. The prosecution had argued that Paik's possession of Chiranjib's mobile phone linked him to the killing. But the court rejected that logic, questioning why a murderer would hold onto such incriminating evidence.",Kolkata resident raja paik was arrested in sept 2017 for the murder of 24-year-old chiranjib gupta in the city.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said that 'Court of Kazi', 'Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat' and 'Sharia Court' have no legal status or recognition in law and any declaration by them, including fatwa issued by them, is not binding on anyone and is unenforceable.A bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Ahsanuddin Amanullah said SC's verdict in 2014 settled the issue of legal status of Sharia courts and reiterated its findings while allowing the maintenance plea of a Muslim woman who is living separately from her husband who invoked 'Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat' to get a talaqnama .""Court of Kazi, Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat, Sharia Court, etc, by whatever name styled have no recognition in law. As noted in Vishwa Lochan Madan (case), any declaration/decision by such bodies, by whatever name labelled, is not binding on anyone and is unenforceable by resort to any coercive measure. The only way such declaration/decision can withstand scrutiny in the eye of law could be when the affected parties accept such declaration/decision by acting thereon or accepting it and when such action does not conflict with any other law. Even then, such declaration/decision, at best, would only be valid inter-se the parties that choose to act upon/accept the same, and not a third party,"" the bench said.In this case, the wife had invoked the family court's jurisdiction to get maintenance which was denied on the ground that it was the second marriage of both husband and wife and she was herself responsible for living separately.Quashing the orders of the family court and Allahabad HC which, too, rejected the maintenance plea, SC said court was not an institution to sermonise society on morality and ethics. Interestingly, the state govt also opposed her plea of maintenance. ""In her application for maintenance filed under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code, the appellant contended that respondent No.2 (husband) had caused cruelty to her as she was not able to fulfil his demand for a motorcycle and Rs 50,000. On this aspect, the family court noted that since it was their second marriage, there is no possibility of demand of dowry by him, as he would be trying to rehabilitate his house. Such reasoning/observation by the family court is unknown to the canons of law and is based on mere conjecture and surmise,"" SC said.""The family court will do well, henceforth, to bear in mind the observation in Nagarathinam v State, that the 'court is not an institution to sermonise society on morality and ethics'. The family court could not have presumed that a second marriage for both parties would necessarily entail no dowry demand,"" it said while granting monthly maintenance of Rs 4,000 to the wife.","Supreme court has said that 'court of kazi', 'court.

The groups also asked Muslim shop-owners to ""write proprietors' names on business establishments"".Goswami told TOI: ""In Vrindavan, some of the intricate crowns and bangles for the deity are made by them (Muslims). Yes, those terrorists (in Pahalgam) should be punished severely and we're totally with govt. But in Vrindavan, Hindus and Muslims live together in peace and harmony."" Most of the priests and locals were in agreement with what Goswami said.Not far from the temple, Javed Ali, who runs a shop under the name 'Star Mukut' and was told to comply or move out, said the priests' stand has given them much-needed succour. ""They (the protesters) came to my shop and asked us to put the name of the proprietor on the signboard. I've been running this shop for over 20 years. My father worked here as a tailor. Whenever a customer buys things, I usually give them a bill receipt with my name and mobile number on it. We have nothing to hide. With the blessings of Banke Bihari, this place is always peaceful,"" Ali said.Nikhil Aggarwal, whose shop is next to Ali's, added they've never had any problem and often support each other. Police said they were yet to receive a formal complaint.","Banke bihari priest and member of the temple's administration committee, gyanendra kishore goswami said monday: ""it is not practical.

NEW DELHI: On a day in which Congress was constrained to gag its netas from making controversial remarks on Pahalgam massacre , BJP stepped up its attack on the party pressing its chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi to specifically respond to the claims of their colleagues that the jihadis had not religiously profiled the victims before killing them.With a Congress neta in Maharashtra seconding Karnataka minister R B Timmapur's comment claim that terrorists had not marked non-Muslims out, BJP's Ravi Shankar Prasad said, ""This is the height of insensitivity.

'Not common for rustic people to be aware of mental illness'

NEW DELHI: An anganwadi worker leading a happy family life in a Chhattisgarh village inexplicably bludgeoned her daughters, aged five and three, to death with a crowbar, cried incessantly after the act and claimed she was possessed by ""invisible powers"" at that time.She was convicted by both trial court and HC for murder and given a life term. But a Supreme Court bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and N Kotiswar Singh on Monday found that the intention to murder was completely absent.Justice Singh reasoned that being possessed by 'invisible powers' could be a temporary medical condition and converted her conviction to culpable homicide not amounting to murder . The bench ordered her release on finding that she had been behind bars for nearly 10 years.Referring to her blabbering that ""she is mata, Budhi Dai etc"" 15 days prior to the incident on June 5, 2015, and the fact that she was taken to hospital for consultation with a psychiatrist, Justice Singh said in rural settings, where superstitions run deep and mental problems often get confused with control of 'invisible powers' over a person, it was possible that she had a sudden bout of mental disorder leading to the killings.""If there were no motivating factors at all which impelled her to commit such a gruesome crime in a domestic environment which was otherwise normal in all respects, it is totally inexplicable and incomprehensible how a mother who loves her children and who had cordial relations with her husband could resort to such a violent act and be attributed with the 'intention to cause death' of her beloved children, except for coming under some influence or forces beyond her control as claimed by her,"" the bench said.""It is not common for rustic persons to be aware of various mental disorders/illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, that may temporarily impair the mental condition of an individual. Often, these disorders are unrecognised and remain untreated as it may be difficult to identify the symptoms and they do not seek proper , resulting in such medical/mental conditions which can be misinterpreted or confused with spells or influence of invisible forces based on superstitions,"" it said.","Anganwadi worker bludgeoned her daughters, aged five and three, to death with a crowbar.

BELAGAVI: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah was accused Monday of threatening to hit a police officer during Congress's Samvidhan Bachao rally at Belagavi 's CPED Ground, moments after a purported security breach saw a group of women BJP workers get on the dais.As the intruders waved black flags and shouted slogans, Siddaramaiah motioned a uniformed officer towards him and demanded to know, ""Who is the SP? What are you doing?""The CM, who sources said was ""quite agitated"", briefly appeared to raise his hand before withdrawing. He ordered the officer to immediately remove the protesters from the dais. AICC general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala and law and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil were both seen trying to calm the CM, but Siddaramaiah allegedly pressed on, asking for additional SP Narayan Baramani . The protesting women were subsequently taken into custody.BJP functionary Shilpa Kekre, among those who had stormed the stage, shouted ""Go to Pakistan"", a reference to Siddaramaiah's alleged comments in Mysuru last week, where he said there was no need to go to war against Pakistan over the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K's Pahalgam.

BENGALURU: Karnataka high court constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to probe data theft at NewSpace Research and Technologies Private Limited by former employees of the drone manufacturing company.The matter will now be reinvestigated by the SIT, headed by DGP Pranab Mohanty. IPS officers Bhushan Gulab Rao Borase and Nisha James will be the other members of the team.In his order, Justice M Nagaprasanna said that the state govt should hand over the investigation right away to the SIT, which will have to submit a report within three months,NewSpace sought an SIT to probe its complaint to police that its former employees stole data and started their own company, compromising national security .The govt's advocate submitted that the earlier investigation officer was embroiled in a corruption case and a new officer took charge. He said the high court can monitor the probe.Justice Nagaprasanna noted that the petitioner has a huge clientele including national security stakeholders like the Indian Army, Air Force, Navy, BEL, HAL, and DRDO, and, that, all its contracts are highly sensitive. The stolen information pertains to a cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).The judge also expressed surprise as to how Prabhat Sharma, former vice-president of NewSpace, who was arrested, was issued a ""notice for appearance"". The judge added that it is only a ""paper arrest.""What should have been custodial interrogation ended up in a mere appearance before the investigating officer, giving rise to doubts of fake investigation, Justice Nagaprasanna observed.""The subject crime has the colour of cyber espionage . Investigations into such crimes demand not merely procedural competence but an amalgamation of technical expertise and forensic acumen.
