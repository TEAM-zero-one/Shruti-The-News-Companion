Did producer-director Sujoy Ghosh violate copyright? Supreme Court to decide on ‘Sabak’ vs ‘Kahaani 2’ row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-producer-director-sujoy-ghosh-violate-copyright-supreme-court-to-decide-on-sabak-vs-kahaani-2-row/articleshow/122216710.cms,"Supreme Court of India (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Is there a ‘Sabak’ (lesson) in the film 'Kahani-2' for producer-director Sanjay Ghosh? The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to adjudicate Ghosh’s petition against criminal proceedings initiated against him in a Hazaribagh court by one Umesh Prasad Mehta, who accused Ghosh of lifting from his literary work “Sabak’.The entire case is a classic example of snail paced three-tiered justice delivery system in India – a simple question whether Ghosh has lifted from Umesh’s work ‘Sabak’ and used it in the script of his film “Kahani-2” has already consumed six years since the Hazaribagh magistrate found a prima facie case and issued summons to Ghosh in 2018. And there is no finality yet to the entire controversy.Ghosh challenged the magistrate’s order before the Jharkhand HC in 2018, and his plea was rejected by the HC only on Apr 22 this year, after nearly seven years. Arguing his appeal against the HC order, senior advocate Siddharth Dave told a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and R Mahadevan that the magistrate, without watching Kahani-2 film, has formed an erroneous prima facie opinion and issued summons to Ghosh.The bench said that it could be proved only in a trial whether the content of ‘Sabak’ has been plagiarised in the script of ‘Kahani-2’. However, it refused to stay the trial proceedings before the Hazaribagh court while exempting Ghosh’s personal appearance before the magistrate.Umesh had alleged that he had given the script of ‘Sabak’ to Ghosh for assistance in obtaining copyright over it. Ghosh later produced ‘Kahani-2” and after watching it at Hazaribagh, Umesh filed a complaint before the trial court alleging that “Ghosh has violated his copyright by committing theft of the script to produce ‘Kahani-2’ film”.The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Hazaribagh, found a prima facie case for the offence punishable under Section 63 of Copyright Act, 1957 and issued summons to Ghosh.",The entire case is a classic example of snail paced three-tiered justice delivery system in india.

NEW DELHI: In a disturbing detail that has emerged from the gangrape case at South Calcutta Law College, police said CCTV footage confirmed that one of the accused, Zaib Ahmed, left the crime scene briefly to buy an inhaler for the victim. He went to a medical store to buy inhaler after she pleaded for relief from breathlessness during the alleged assault.According to investigators, the footage from a nearby medical shop showed Zaib purchasing the inhaler at the victim's request, following her deteriorating condition inside the security guard’s room where the assault took place on the evening of June 25.“The victim said she had begged for medical help after falling ill during the torture. The accused denied taking her to a hospital but did get her an inhaler from a pharmacy. She felt better temporarily, but the torture continued,” a senior officer told news agency PTI.The pharmacy owner told police that Zaib attempted to split the payment, partly in cash and partly through UPI, but eventually paid the full amount online.

The two have since been questioned regarding their conversation.Investigators are also questioning 16 individuals, mostly students, seen in the college premises via CCTV footage after class hours on June 25.

NEW DELHI: ED on Wednesday told a special court that former Congress presidents Sonia and Rahul Gandhi wanted to take over a Rs 2,000 crore company - Associated Journals Limited (AJL) - that once published party organ National Herald.The agency, through additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju, submitted before the court of Special Judge Vishal Gogne that a conspiracy was hatched to create Young Indian Pvt Ltd, a not-for-profit company, in which Sonia and Rahul held 76% shares (38% each), to siphon off assets of AJL in lieu of repaying a Rs 90 crore loan (taken by AJL) to Congress. This debt was converted into equity in favour of Young Indian (YI), ED argued.The agency argued that the whole scheme was conceived for the benefit of the Gandhis, who controlled YI as well as AJL, the latter, while being in loss, had enough assets to repay the loan.""Losses were to the tune of Rs 70 lakh. They (YI) didn't even have the wherewithal to pay Rs 50 lakh. During this time, Rahul and Sonia were directors of the company along with Sam Pitroda and others,"" said Raju, adding that AJL was not making profit but it had assets worth Rs 2,000 crore.""How come they (AJL and its functionaries) didn't have Rs 90 crore to repay the loan (given by Congress)? Any prudent person would've sold their assets to repay loans. This is absurd and can never be explained,"" the ASG argued.The hearing saw Raju refuting the suggestion that since AJL was started by the first PM, Jawahar Lal Nehru, it was alright for Congress to acquire it.Referring to Sonia and Rahul, ED said till 2015, only these two individuals were the actual beneficiaries with full control over AJL's assets and functioning.The court will continue to hear arguments on Thursday too. ""AJL was not making a profit but it had large assets of Rs 2,000 crore. They were finding it difficult to manage their daily affairs. Thus, a Rs 90 crore loan was taken from Congress,"" ASG submitted.He said several senior Congress functionaries engaged in fake transactions that existed only on paper to divert funds to AJL, adding that fabricated rent receipts and fraudulent advance rent payments were made over several years.","Ed told a special court that former congress presidents sonia and rahul gandhi wanted to take over a rs 2,000 crore company.

It's after a gap of 15 years that the PU colleges will get principals recommended by the university service commission.Usually, the appointment of a college principal is done by vice-chancellor of the university concerned.However, following allegations of foul play in appointment of principals in some universities, governor-cum-chancellor Arif Mohammed Khan ordered that the posting of BSUSC-recommended candidates would be done through a lottery system under the supervision of a three-member committee, headed by the VC of the university concerned.In the case of five PU colleges, the names were picked through a draw supervised by a committee consisting of VC Ajay Kumar Singh, registrar Shalini and the chancellor's representative, Rahmat Jahan. Some senior academics, however, raised questions over the appointments through lottery. How could a home science teacher manage an institution of commerce, or a chemistry teacher administer an institution specialising in humanities & social sciences, they asked.","Nagendra prasad verma, a history teacher at chapra's jai prakash university, was selected as principal of magadh mahila college in patna.

Complainant drove rashly, broke rules before car toppled

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday said insurance companies are not bound to pay compensation to the kin of drivers who die due to their own mistake during daredevil stunts or on account of rash and negligent driving, in an extreme message to speed addicts and those who seek to hog eyeballs by performing stunts, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Justices P S Narasimha and R Mahadevan refused to give relief to the wife, son and parents of a man who died while driving a car at high speed in a rash and negligent act which ended with the vehicle toppling over.Dismissing the claim petition of his kin, who demanded Rs 80 lakh as compensation from United India Insurance Company, the bench said that family members cannot demand an insurance payout when death is caused due to a mistake on part of the deceased without involvement of any extraneous factors. The SC upheld the decision of Karnataka HC on Nov 23 last year rejecting their claim for compensation.On June 18, 2014, one N S Ravisha was driving a Fiat Linea from Mallasandra village to Arasikere town, with his father, sister and her children as co-passengers. He drove rashly and at a high speed and broke traffic rules before losing control of the vehicle near Mylanahalli gate, Arasikere. The car toppled over and rolled on the road.Ravisha succumbed to injuries sustained in the accident. His wife, son and parents claimed compensation of Rs 80 lakh on the grounds that he was a busy contractor earning Rs 3 lakh per month. The police filed a chargesheet claiming that the accident occurred because of Ravisha's rash and negligent driving. The Motor Accident Tribunal rejected the family's claim.Hearing an appeal, Karnataka HC rejected the claim of Ravisha's kin that the accident was caused due to a tyre burst and said, ""when a claim is made by legal representatives of the deceased, it has to be proved that the deceased was not himself responsible for the accident by his rash and negligent driving and it would also be necessary to prove that the deceased would be covered under the policy so as to make the insurance company liable to make payment to the legal heirs. "" The court added, ""In the instant case, admittedly the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the deceased himself and he being a self-tortfeasor, the legal heirs cannot claim any compensation for his death"".","Supreme court refuses to give relief to the wife, son and parents of a man who died while driving a car at high speed.

The CM said ""hasty approval and distribution"" of the vaccine could be a reason.The Centre said studies by ICMR and AIIMS have established there was no link between the jabs and the deaths, adding, ""Sudden cardiac deaths can result from many factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions and post-Covid complications."" tnnSeveral studies worldwide have recently indicated that Covid vaccines could be a cause for the increasing number of heart attacks,"" the Karnataka CM had said, adding a committee of experts has been formed under the leadership of Dr Ravindranath, director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, to identify the exact cause and they have been instructed to submit a study report within 10 days.Dr Amit Bhushan Sharma, cardiologist at Paras Health in Gurugram, said in most cases of cardiac arrest deaths, the root causes are underlying health conditions like undiagnosed coronary artery disease, inherited heart disorders, or lifestyle factors such as chronic stress, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity.","Karnataka cm siddaramaiah claimed over 20 people had died of heart attack in a month.

NEW DELHI: Consumption of protein rich food in India has inched up in over a decade but fat intake has risen at a faster pace. Latest data released Wednesday showed cereals continue to be the most important source of protein among the five major food groups.The data released by the statistics office showed an increasing trend in daily intake of protein by individuals in urban as well as rural India since 2009-10 and trend was evident in most major states. Rajasthan, Haryana, Maharashtra and UP, however, showed a marginal decline in average protein intake. In urban areas, daily per capita intake of protein rose from 58.8 gms 2009-10 to 63.4 gms per day in 2023-24, an increase of 8%, while in rural areas, it rose at a slower pace, from 59.3 gms a day in 2009-10 to 61.8 gms in 2023-24.Pulses consumption in rural areas rose marginally, while it dipped in urban centres. In both areas, egg, meat and fish consumption saw the steepest rise. In the case of fat intake, there is an unmistakable rising trend, with every major state showing an increase, according to the Nutritional Intake report released by the statistics ministry based on the Household Consumption Expenditure survey of 2022-23 and 2023-24.At the all-India level, the rise has been from 43.1 gms per person per day in 2009-10 for the rural population to 60.4 gms in 2023-24 and from 53.0 gms to 69.8 gms for the urban - a rise of more than 15 gms in both segments. All the major states show a rise in per capita per day intake of fat across rural and urban segments, the data showed.The data showed that cereals accounted for 46-47% of the share of protein in rural areas among the five major food groups, which include pulses, milk and milk products, eggs, meat and fish and other food category. In urban areas, it was about 39% for 2022-23 and 2023-24. The report showed that the contribution of cereals to protein intake has fallen by about 14% in rural India and nearly 12% in urban India from 2009-10. The fall in the share of cereals has been balanced by rise in the share of egg, fish and meat, other food and milk and milk products, the data showed.","Cereals continue to be the most important source of protein among the five major food groups.

EC yet to hear from oppn after Cong plea for 'urgent' meet

NEW DELHI: Netas of the INDIA bloc met the Election Commission on Wednesday to question the timing of the special intensive revision (SIR) of the Bihar electoral roll, saying it comes too close to the ensuing assembly poll. They also complained that EC's guidelines, including only those who are 'ordinarily resident' in a constituency, may affect migrants who form a significant part of the Bihar electorate.The opposition told EC that SIR could be ""disastrous"" as it could lead to the deletion of ""tens of lakhs"" of genuine voters, especially those on the margins. Eleven opposition parties that met EC comprised Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, JMM, NCP-SP, Shiv Sena (UBT), CPI(M), CPI and CPI(ML) Liberation.Congress had approached the Election Commission on June 30 seeking an ""urgent"" meeting ""any time after 4 pm on July 2"" between the poll panel and a delegation comprising 10 opposition parties to discuss the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of rolls in Bihar. However, EC, despite promptly writing back to each of the 10 parties to indicate availability of their representatives at 5 pm on July 2, is yet to hear from them.EC sources said the ""July 2"" meeting with the multi-party opposition delegation thus stood deferred as no confirmations were received.Sources told TOI that while the mail received from a legal counsel of the All India Congress Committee for the multi-party delegation's appointment with EC was unilateral - with no similar email received from the remaining nine parties or the AICC mail marked to them - the panel in its response sent the same day to each party - Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, NCP, JMM, CPI, CPM and CPI(ML) Liberation - welcoming their request and seeking their confirmations for a meeting at 5 pm on July 2. However, not one of the parties, Congress included, had responded to EC's mail till late Tuesday, said EC sources.Even so, a TMC delegation met EC on Tuesday as part of its consultation with parties on all poll-related issues.","Ec yet to hear from oppn after cong plea for 'urgent' meet on july 2.

Inspection of medical colleges is undertaken by the NMC on a periodic basis to assess whether they meet the minimum essential standards specified by the Under-Graduate Medical Education Board or the Post-Graduate Medical Education Board, as the case may be. Inspections are also undertaken before allowing medical institutions to increase seats. In May, the CBI arrested a senior doctor working as assessor with the NMC immediately after he received a bribe of Rs 10 lakh allegedly in exchange for a positive assessment report linked to a private medical college in Karnataka. The NMC, in a statement issued on Wednesday, said they have decided to blacklist the said assessor, pending investigation and final verdict in the matter.","The national medical commission (nmc) sought to distance itself from assessors engaged by it to conduct inspections in medical institutions on its behalf.

NMC stalls on making med college assessments public,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nmc-stalls-on-making-med-college-assessments-public/articleshow/122213243.cms,"Nine months after the National Medical Commission (NMC) decided to seek legal opinion on whether the assessment forms of medical colleges can be made public, the matter remains unresolved as NMC claimed, in response to an RTI query, that the file is still ""under process"". As a result, MBBS aspirants are forced to choose medical colleges without access to details of the assessment of the infrastructure and faculty available in a college.The chief information commissioner had ordered the NMC several times in 2024 to make assessment reports public, stating that ""disclosing these assessment reports is essential for the aspiring medical students seeking admission"".Neither reports of inspection of medical colleges nor standard assessment forms (SAF) are being made public by the NMC. The SAF is mandatory and is meant as an annual self-declaration by a medical college giving information about infrastructure, faculty, patient load, academic activities and so on. In the NMC meeting held on Sept 23, 2024, ""the commission opined that the SAF form need not be in public domain"" and instructed its Medical Assessment and Rating Board to take further action. However, according to the minutes of the meeting obtained through RTI, V Hekali Zhimomi, an additional secretary in the health ministry, suggested that an opinion should be obtained from the department of legal affairs.When RTI activist Dr KV Babu asked about the status of the SAF disclosure issue, the NMC responded that ""file for seeking legal opinion on the matter of SAF disclosure is under process and hence the information in this regard is not available"".NMC had brought in the Aadhaar-Enabled Biometric Attendance System in Aug 2018, but found that people were using silicon thumb imprints to manipulate the system. To counter this, the NMC mandated face-based Aadhaar authentication for faculty attendance in medical colleges from April this year.However, the NMC seems reluctant to adopt the simplest system of making colleges' self-declarations public so that students and public could verify if the faculty, infrastructure and patient load being claimed in the declaration were indeed available. The Medical Council of India, which the NMC replaced, used to make the assessment reports of all medical colleges public. It also used to put up the minutes of all meetings in the public domain. The NMC doesn't do either.","The national medical commission (nmc) decided to seek legal opinion on whether the assessment forms of medical colleges can be made public.
